The hike is now a loop as they've added an entire new section along the other side of the Cape. You can still do it as an out and back if you like but the new part has several new look offs added so I would recommend doing the loop. The loop itself is about 13k but with the added treks to the look offs it's probably more like 14-14.5k if you do the loop and look offs.\n\nWhen we arrived the parking lot was jam packed so be aware that if you're going there on the weekend and the weather is nice, it will be packed...and I mean packed.\n\nWe went to the point on the old trail and returned on the new trail. The old trail was extremely muddy so if you go after a rain, waterproof footwear is recommended. The trail was the same as the parking lot...busy. I'm not a fan of crowded hiking trails so I don't find that very enjoyable.\n\nWhen we reached the point it was crazy windy...like difficult to stand up windy. The views from the point are nothing short of spectacular.\n\nWe returned on the new trail which is slightly longer than the old trail to the point. Part of the reason for this is the trail is extremely curvy, winding through the woods. To the point that at times it actually seems unnecessary. But it is a nice trail with less mud then in the way in, but muddy non the less.\n\nThe look offs are a nice addition but are a bit disappointing when you get to them given the extra distance to reach them (3 in total although one was not completed when we were there). "", 'Great', ""The new loop makes the hike definitely longer, but it's nice to have a change in scenery and the new lookoff spots. I went after the rain, and the new path was almost as muddy as the old path. There was a lot of people on the trails too - never seen it so busy in the past."", ""Lovely views at the point, however the majority of the hike is forested without views. The trail was also very busy (Saturday). With the new loop the trail is 13.3km plus going to the viewpoint at the middle makes it more like 14km. If you don't want that long of hike, you can definitely find similar views on shorter hikes. "", 'Love the new addition to make this a loop with some great lookoffs.  The new/lower trail was extremely mucky and made it a little trickier but 10/10 recommend this trail!', 'Very muddy on lower trail/ upper not too bad', 'Love the loop. Great look offs. Really nice trail experience improvements!', 'Beautiful trail. Walked it today after a downpour and it was very muddy and slick the majority of the way. The new loop was much less muddy, so would recommend that route.', 'Nice trail, very hot today, so turned around after 3km in.', 'Beautiful drive to the trail. The trail was somewhat hilly and rooty but fairly easy. Several muddy sections even after a dry August. The top is amazing and there are a few other pretty look offs as well. It took me 3 hours to go out and back.', 'Beautiful trail, largely shaded until you get to the tip. Main trail is muddy in several places, as noted by several reviewers, so be prepared! New “loop” much less muddy and has several look off points which are beautiful and worth stepping of the trail to see! Bring lots of water!! Definitely worth the effort and would do it again in a heartbeat!', 'Amazing views. A few muddy spots but well worth it. ', 'The trail is in good condition. 13km total round trip. The first 2km are the elevation, the rest is fairly flat. The views are very rewarding. Would advise going early in the morning as the traffic seemed to increase at around noon.  We were on the trail at 7 am, no one else out there. ', 'Excellent trail.  New section is very nice addition.  ', 'New trail is great. Muddy in areas, but trail is new. Great lookoff spots along the way.', 'Big rain the day before but great sunny day for our hike the day after. Trail was muddy in many places from the rain. Worth the walk once you get to see the view!', 'Super muddy conditions this weekend. But overall a great trail. Very busy on the weekends, start early to get a parking spot. ', 'Beautiful day out there! VERY muddy trail conditions right now - make sure to dress for it :)', 'The ending makes this trail totally worth it! We went for sunset and the trail is clear enough easily manage with headlamps or flashlights. ', 'Great hike.  Took a little under 4 hours. Better in hiking boots than shoes.', 'Muddy in some spots. Bring a backpack with a picnic lunch and water and you’re all set. Definitely worth it! We did it in just under 4 hours in and back ', 'Super busy on a long weekend. But v lovely.', 'WELL worth it! It’s a bit taxing early on, as you’ll do most of the incline within the first 2 km or so. From there, muddy puddles regularly occur, most of which are easy to walk around via an outer edge, others requiring a bit more fun, careful planning (be careful - it can be slick if you attempt to hop over any portion, and you may take a “banana peel” spill). I found it quite fun, kinda of like a video game in dodging these little obstacles (felt like playing Crash Bandicoot to be specific. Anyhow, the view from the top is one of the most vast, amazing panoramas I’ve ever seen in my life!! It was so windy up there that you could almost lean forward and have it hold you upright. The walk back is much easier, as all of that ascension early on is downhill on the way out. This one is an absolute must-do!\n\nAlso - I didn’t encounter a single bug. Hiked it early August on a sunny morning 9:00-12:30.', 'Excellent trek through the woods. It was raining H.A.R.D. the day we went but that didn’t take away from the hike… great views at the end with one other look-off to the right as you go in.  Well worth the walk.', 'Nice moderate trail. Not too steep but there is some muddy stretches at the beginning (even on a sunny, dry day. View at the end of the cape makes for a satisfying midpoint but perhaps doesn’t justify the hike on its own.', 'Great views from the lookout midway to the end of the point', 'Superbe randonnée\n', 'Trail is very wet in some places. Nice easy hike.', 'It was pretty muddy so wear proper  shoes.  Spectacular view for a picnic at the end', 'Heavily treed, creeks running through paths, mucky and challenging at times with hills. Worth the view. Waterproof boots recommended. 9/10', 'Awesome', ""Great hike, the trail was quite wet so wear appropriate footwear.  The new path isn't open as of July 15, I would be very surprised if it is open by the end of the summer.  Great views on the top."", 'Great hike…not overly difficult (just long), easy to follow, trail goes through woods until it opens to a beautiful vista at the end. New loop trail still not open. Some muddy areas but fairly easy to navigate around them.', 'well marked along the trail with how far you are. ', 'Really really lovely. Warm in the trees but the view at the end is well worth it', 'I admit, this ranks first on my list of hikes to date. This is one of Nova Scotia’s majestic gems, overlooking the Bay of Fundy. The tidal action here is impressive. The trail is 12.1 km out and back, between 3 - 5 hours. We spent most of our time admiring the view and had a mini picnic with a beautiful view.', 'Trail is mostly dry with very few bugs but many hikers! New look off deck is lovely. The trails for new loop are not open and are taped off.   Sunny most of the way but unfortunately foggy at the point. Will try again another time but a wonderful trail nonetheless. ', 'great hike. super foggy at the end. ', 'A long hike! Trail is covered in shade￼. Great workout the first 20 minutes is rocky and a lot of up hill. Definitely worth it yeah ', ""Great! frist time won't be the last! went with my brother and Luna. trail was in great shape 2 hrs in at an easy going pace. 3 hours out. massive amount of people. nice day. We went in early and coming out tge cars were lined down the road with tge parking lot cramed. traffic the only reason not 5/5 views and hike are spot on fir a day hike. and dine by noon "", 'Spectacular dramatic exhausting', 'A bit muddy and be for quite a long trek up hill. Well worth it though. Beautiful!', 'Hard pack with some wet spots. A blast of a trail to run. Some nice speedy sections. Absolutely stunning view at the turn around. ', 'Amazing.', 'great easy to follow trail. bit muddy in spots, and good boots are definitely a plus.\n\n ', 'The new loop is still rough and closed. Adds 3K and lots of rollers!', 'Great trail for a late morning hike. Pack a lunch to eat when you’re at the top! Perfect picnic spot, although it can be windy.', 'Excellent trail conditions today, almost all dry, very few mucky spots. The new trail on the Scots Bay side is not yet opened; park staff told us the projected opening is not until August.', 'The trail was in great condition after the winter. A little bit muddy today, but only near the front end of the trail. I was happy to see new offshoots from the main trail (official, not footpaths) including a new look off!', 'A beautiful trail at any hour of any season. The trail is hard-packed dirt, so even if it might get a bit muddy, it’s never too deep or unnavigable.\n\nThe seagulls roosting on the furthest outcropping are a beautiful sight when they wake up and start to stretch their wings.', 'Really well signposted, but also well trodden so you can’t go wrong. A great hike on a lovely sunny day!', 'Great hike. Beautiful view. The first km or a bit more is wet still this spring. Otherwise perfect!', 'Nice hike, a bit muddy as the snow has just melted.￼ we only did the 1st part.', 'Super muddy trail but completely worth it to make it to the end.', 'Beautiful views and awesome place to bring your furry friend! Was pretty icy during the hike, so would definitely recommend as a summer/late fall adventure! ', 'Really great trail.  A little icy this time of year so some sort of traction for your shoes is a good idea.', 'We hiked on Jan 16 and the trail was in great condition! Only 1 section about 1-2k in that was icy, the rest was just nicely packed snow, great traction.  Awesome day! ', 'The trail was quite icy in places, and wet and muddy in others, but this didn’t seem to deter anyone as there was a fair amount of traffic on this beautiful winter day.', 'Minimal ice, great day out!', 'Lovely trail with an absolutely stunning view at the end of the peninsula. Well worth it. \n\nVery touristy and busy on weekends. If you want a quieter hike, weekday mornings are best for this one. ', ""It's a long walk, took me about 3 hours one way, but well worth it!  The trail itself was in good condition with roots and rocks exposed but a good mix between uphill and level with 2 look out points before arriving at the end. One bathroom due to Covid.\n"", 'Only mucky in a couple spots. They are building some new lookoffs. Perfect temperature: 15c.', 'Great hike! Had a beautiful day!', 'Great spot', 'Breathtaking.', 'Great! Slow and steady until the end', 'Mind breaker', 'A bit muddy on some parts but it was to be expected after heavy rains the day before.  Beautiful scenery from the top not much to see on the way up. Worth bring a snack to sit and take in the view.', 'Great hike. Very busy spot today as its a long weekend but people were very curious and kept distance as much as possible. Will be back. ', 'Fantastic', 'Highly recommend this trail! Easy to moderate hiking. \n', 'Easy hike. Only scenery was at the end', 'Moderate trail, the view at the end of the trail is breathtaking. ', 'Well kept trail! Beautiful views! ', 'Perfect hike with beautiful view at the end. Lots of inclines to get a good burn going. ', 'great trail!! we took both our dogs (collie & chi) and they loved it. couple must spots but easily walked around. the lookout was busy but stunning views! ', 'Great hike day today. Trail is in great shape - the few mucky spots from recent rain are all passable by going around the puddles. No damage or impassable spots to report. ', 'Recommend the trek up and back. Don’t go do the loop. Too bushwacky so difficult for what it’s worth.', ""Very nice trail! Fairly busy, but well kept. Entire trail is forested, so it's nicely shaded and keeps the wind out. After an hour or so, we made it to the end and BOOM! Gale force winds when we reached the opening to the Split. Probably so windy that it limited our stay to about 15 minutes, so we hiked 'er back. All in all, took around 2h15m to complete at a pretty decent pace. Definitely recommend this trail, though! Surrounding area of Wolfville is always a nice stay, as well. Terrific area."", 'Amazing hike. Busier than I expected but lovely. Tough in places. The view at the point is breathtaking!', 'I did this trail in June 2020, it was excellent! Took my 2 dogs, lots of water. the trail was beautiful and the view at the end was spectacular. would definately recommend this trail. ', 'Great trail, amazing views. Some steep inclines and a long trek but in the end, it’s worth it', 'Great trail well maintained.  Not too difficult terrain.  Took us 3 hours round trip ', 'Beautiful view. Clear trail, not too busy when we went and didn’t run into any bugs', 'Well maintained', ""First time doing a hike. Went with my nieces and a friend. First of all, I have lower back issues, being a person that loves a challenge. I decided to wear my 10lb vest. Thought it was a 2.5 hr walk in and out! NO!  Realized we were in for a very long hike. I was hurting so bad by the time we got to the split. It was definitely worth every bit of pain that I encountered! We sat and ate lunch. Took beautiful pictures. It was difficult going  back. Feet were feeling pain. But I wouldn't change a thing.....now I'm in love with hiking!!"", 'Nice easy walk. Mostly up grade to the end, wide path, some roots and rocks to stumble over. Lots of parking and bathrooms at the beginning and half way point.', 'Whew! Hiked Cape Split in May and it was a great adventure. The forest is beautiful, lots of plants and flowers, and you get little peeks of the ocean through the trees. Very peaceful and dreamy. And then the end!! Super climactic, especially on a windy day. I came through the trees and then BAM blasted by wind. My cheeks were flappin! So fun! \n\nAlso! I encourage you to look up the Indigenous histories and presents of the land you’re hiking on. Think about what it means as settlers to use this unceded Mi’kmaq land for pleasure. ', 'Great hike. Watch the weather as it can be windy and foggy at the split while being sunny in the parking lot', 'Great view at the end. It was a little muddy in places but overall really well kept.', 'Amazing. It was an easy trail.', 'Beautiful trail. The hike is mainly in the woods and there are some very steep inclines. None of the 12km has a view of the basin or Bay of Fundy, but the view at the end is spectacular. The actual hiking trail is beautiful but is 100% forest. The paths are narrow so passing people doesn’t allow for the ‘Covid 6ft’. There are some washrooms at the start of the trail and half way up. The half way up ones are in the shade so smelt slightly better on a hot day! :) ', 'Great day on the trail. Lots of hills and a beautiful view. \nShould have benches for people to stop and rest and snack.  ', 'Challenging but well maintained and marked path. Definitely worth the view!', 'Took 4.5 hours (including exploring the cape, and having a snack) with a 9 year old that does not hike. Worth it, amazing view!', 'It was a great to do this trail again although it felt a bit longer than I remember. Very quiet, went on a Wednesday afternoon.  ', 'Great Hike... Easy to hike... well maintained! view at the end is just amazing!', 'Beautiful reward at the end. Mostly wooded and hilly trail to get there but well maintained. Loop at the end is not a part of the official trail and is overgrown in parts. Try going on a clear day. ', 'what a great trail. busy but lots to look at.', 'Awesome hike today but watch out for the tree you have to duck under... I wasn’t so fortunate and ended up hitting my head', 'Wonderful hike, slightly busy. Beautiful view at the top and lots of grass to sit for some food.\nA bit of a rocky climb at the beginning but overall not too hard of a hike.\nMy phone died when we were at the top eating so this record is half the hike.', 'Awesome Hike. More on the easier side of moderate. Worth doing the loop at the end. Nice and isolated from the wind and sun. \n\nWindy at the cape split look off. Bring a jacket. \n\nYou can take a little trail down to the water by holding on to a sketchy rope. \n\nTook about 3hrs of moving time including the dip down to the waterfront from the loop. \n\nWould Love to come back and trail run the out and back. ', 'Foggy today but still a fantastic hike. Took about 3.5 hrs ', 'One of our favorite hikes in Nova Scotia.  Hiked it today, including the little loop along the south side.  Lots of blowdown from last fall on that little stretch.  Beautiful!', ""Nice trail, ran about half of it, I'm sure it's a nice view at the end, unfortunately it was really foggy for us."", 'Super nice trail!! Took us 2 hours and a bit to complete the whole trail and return to the parking lot. We ran the last couple kilometres which made the return trip take about 45 minutes and the trip up to the peak was about 1.15 hours. The trees provide some shade but sunscreen and bug spray is a must! A bit muddy at the beginning of the trail but dry after he first 2 k', 'awesome trail! it’s a pretty easy one, just straight up and then straight down. trail was very wide and well maintained. it was windy but it was great because it kept the bugs off! dogs loved it even on the leash. 12k felt like nothing, took us about 3.5 hours to do it not including the lunch break we took at the top, and a few water breaks. ', 'We hiked this trail yesterday and the flowers were beautiful! Loads of trillium. The downside was it was a busy day on the trail. 50 cars in the lot when arrived at noon. Because of the pandemic and social distancing it was not a good experience. Most of the hikers were collage age adults and were hiking in groups and walking abreast making it hard to pass at a 6 foot distance , so we were forced to step off the trail when we met them. They did not offer to step off for us. The older hikers that we met did step off the trail when meeting us. We counted 118 people while we were hiking. Also garbage has been left to pile up beside the garbage bins even though parks have stated they are not doing garbage collection there at this time. A great hike but not worth the risk at this time ', 'Very windy once you’re at the top, the view is amazing at the end! Definitely one of the longer hikes I’ve been on in awhile but already can’t wait to go again, all around great trail', 'Completed this one in 2014 and is one of my all-time favourites. The 12km is pretty steady and not too difficult terrain-wise. The view at the end is inxredible; definitely bring your cameras! ', 'Awesome trail with incredible views. There is a decent climb over the first 2km or so but otherwise the trail is moderate to easy. \n\nWe completed the loop at the end of the trail - and that I would not recommend for the less experienced hiker. There are a couple bonus views, but the trail is very overgrown and has a lot of trees down, making it hard to keep on trail in places. It’s best done as an out and back trail unless you’re looking for a challenge.', 'Went on a cloudy day , the trail was not so hard and the view at the end was definitely worth it. But the wind was wild, have felt wind this strong in my life. Be extra careful while at the edge of the cliff.', 'Nice easy trail. I did it when it was a bit cold on 19th March 2020 so the mud was frozen. very nice view at the end. ', 'Every time of year has its perks. Every time of day has its perks. A busy area, but a classic. ', 'Snow over ice on the trail made it easy to hike. Lots of water views through the bare trees. Windy and frigid at the point so couldn’t stay there long. A beautiful trail any season.', 'a friend and I hiked this a few yrs ago..its was a blast we geocached in so took us a bit longer..alday adventure..we loved it', 'Very muddy, adds time to your estimate because some areas are slow to get through with slippery spots. Leave enough time to get out before dark. We will be back again', 'Hiked 11/3/19. Epic overlook, but relatively boring and crowded hike to get to it. Hiked early, and saw no one on the hike out, but there were a handful of people at the overlook and many heading in as we hiked out. There were currently some muddy sections and downed trees in the trail, but all are easily navigable. The view at the end makes this hike worth it. \nI’m confused by the reviews saying it took an hour or 2. It is over 8 miles (4 each way). ', 'Lovely trail. With a great reward at the end of a wonderful view but there may be crowds including dogs. Oct 20th the  outhouses part way along were locked down that is not noted on the sign at the trailhead.', 'Great trail. Only one tree left on the trail from the hurricane. Very unhappy about all the tissue and toilet paper along the trail. PLEASE walk off the trail to do your business and bag your tissue to take out. Think of the other users.', 'Nice trail with amazing seaside view', 'love cape split, one of my favourites! i’ve done it a few times and loved every minute. last time it took just over and hour to walk, can’t wait to go back.', 'It’s an ok hike...I probably wouldn’t repeat it.', 'Decent Saturday afternoon outing, took my partner and I 2 and a bit hours including a short stop at the point. Very busy and very mild trail. ', 'We did the entire trail (minus the loop) in three hours. Quite easy getting around the muddy spots. View at the tip worth the hike.', 'muddy. only complaint.', ""Typically a very busy trail - but there is lots of room at the end to look around. Bring a sweater if you intend on staying for a bit at the look off part, it's always windy and little cooler there compared to the hike in from the parking lot"", ""I am happy to have done this hike. The view at the end is amazing and I'm happy I got to get out there to enjoy it in person. I am very impressed with how quick the storm damage (Dorion 2019) was cleared off the trail I would say right up to the 5 km mark there were obvious signs of work that had been done to remove giant trees and logs Dorian left in the way. Navigation and Terrain wise I would put this on the easier end of hikes, length and a couple of heart rate raising hills do definitely push it to the moderate rating it but for my self I guess you could say I was slightly underwhelmed with it as far as a challenge goes but everything else was fantastic. Probably wouldn't drive the hour and a half to make this a regular hike but again happy to have done and will likely do again if in the area or the opportunity came up. "", 'Fantastic hike any time of day you start it. Trail is easy to follow. Expect mud, roots and rocks. I hiked solo and with 20 mins at the top I clocked 2.5hours. I was able to do this hike in trail running shoes. There’s elevation gain in the beginning then  flat and rolling and back to very flat along the ridge. Great day! Started at 2pm out by 4:30pm 9/20/19. Love it!!!', 'went the day after hurricane dorian.', 'Lots of roots, watch your footing!', 'The loop trail was very overgrown. Wear appropriate clothing and footwear. The beach is well worth a visit though', 'wear good shoes and be prepared for mud! But so worth it! Bring a picnic and enjoy the views!', 'Great trail with good elevation change, fantastic view at the end. Hiked in August and was busy, on and off leash dogs and a bit of mud but navigable.', 'Hiking, rock climbing, and walking the beach, all within one hours hike.', ""just over 6km to the viewpoint, we got there at sunset and the sights were amazing. The loop at the end is possible to travel however it's not really maintained (overgrown , fallen trees, etc..) its much easier to go out the way you came in. there was a little bit of mud in some spots but there always seems to be an alternate route to get around it."", 'what a view! the trail is amazing, it took us about 4 hours to complete. 6kms each way and a break to take in the stunning views at the end. proper footwear is necessary; we went ealier in the summer and there was quite a bit of mud & water in spots. bring a camera :)', 'Well maintained trail- great out and back with incredible views at the end! Enjoyed it very much.', 'The trail is a little over 6km in each direction, so over 12km total. I was walking a very brisk pace and was able to get to the end in a little over an hour. Stayed at the end for about a half hour and took me about an hour and 15 mins to walk back. So overall I clocked in at less than 3 hours. The path is pretty much boring woods the entire way until the end, but the end is pretty fabulous!  I would not recommend this trail for small kids, or at least be prepared for it to take quite a while. Weather was perfect the day I went and it hadn’t rained for a few days before, so there wasn’t much mud at all. I really recommend for anyone willing to commit to a long hike...Although if you’re fit and keep a decent pace, under 3 hours is possible!', 'my 3 year old made it to the end. i only had to carry him for the last 3km on the way back.\ni would call this pretty easy.', 'Absolutely amazing trail.

Definitely a sight to see at the end as well!!!', 'Literally almost the whole hike you’re in the woods until you come to the end. But it is 110% worth it. \nI recommend good hiking shoes as the way there is almost all uphill. Some muddy spaces that you are able to go around. \n\nIf the view doesn’t knock your socks off. I don’t know what will. \n\nThe only downside is the loop you see in the map seems to be quite overgrown. ', 'Hike was easy and flat for the most part with a few gentle inclines. Definitely worth it for the view!', 'Wauw, wat a nice trail! ☀️', 'Super muddy with all the rain lately but very manageable. A couple steep bits but my Alberta lungs has no trouble with any of it. Yay for sea level hiking!  Amazing views at the end and we had the perfect sunny day to capture them. ', 'Great trail, it was super clear and there is a great open area at the end to picnic. Some mud from rain 1.5 days ago. \nThe extra loop at the end does exist, but it is very overgrown, you’ll get scratches from bushes ect, but it a fun adventure! No steep incline like shown in the elevation map, but still more difficult than mail trail. Views not as good either.', 'A good long hike that features a pleasant forest walk along a well-maintained trail and spectacular views at the end of the cape. We took a deliberate but unhurried two hours to reach the end of the cape, an hour for lunch and to enjoy the sights, and two hours to walk back. Well worth the effort. Contrary to what is shown on the map there is no loop trail at the end of the cape (mid-way through the walk) — it’s out and back along the same trail.

Not too steep and a very well maintained path. The only struggle point was to get the path down and back up.

A bit muddy in spots and lots of furry dog friends in tow. Beautiful scenic drive and a side trip to Wolfville make for a perfect day trip!', 'Good trail. It was nice and private feeling with it being a really bad weather day. However in the shelter of the trees it was wonderful. The mud was bad.

I did trailrun it this Tuesday, my 2 friends hiked it. We were the only 3 people on the trail. There was a mix of snow and ice on the trail but easy enough for us to run/hike.

For trail runners, it’s generally moderate difficulty with a few more technical spots and lots of exposed rocks and roots-broke my toe on the way in a few years ago.

Trail was in good condition although some mud and water in places. Hard packed with roots and rocks. In the trees for most of the hike and then arrive in the meadow overlooking Cape Split.

Went on a Sunday and there were quite a few fellow hikers. I’d recommend going during the week if you enjoy solitude. Of the 12+ km’s i’d say half was uphill. Lots of stones and roots to be mindful of. A bit muddy in spots. Nice view at the end.', 'Walked this trail yesterday with a couple of my friends. None of us are hikers by any means. The moderate difficulty is definitely reasonable— my non-hiker body is quite tired and sore the day after, and my friends and I took several breaks throughout. We took about four hours total. We’re from Halifax, so it was about an hour and a half drive to get there— fun little roadtrip if you’re from the city! The first half of the hike is quite hilly, but it flattens out during the latter half. View at the end is well worth the hike, in my opinion! I’d highly suggest bug repellant of some sort, especially during this time of year. All in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend it!', 'This is a nice undulating hike thru natural forest. The actual Cape Split was well worth the hike. \nIt took us 3hrs round trip and enjoyed the plentiful greenery and the beautiful vista at the point.', 'Your average Canadian Forest hike for the most part, but it ends on an amazing view.  The local Chipmunks were also super friendly, allowing me to get some great shots of them.', 'This trail has been on my “hikes to do” list for years, but I always kept putting it off. The views at the end always intrigued me, but the descriptions/review of the actual hike always sounded less than exciting. I envisioned it to be too easy, I prefer a more challenging hike, but in the end, the hike was good, it had a couple good inclines and lots of roots and rocks to avoid. It’s a long trek though,  we moved fairly quickly and it took us 2.5 hrs, but it probably takes most people 3-4 hrs. Bring a sweater for the end, it’s damn cold out there! It was 30 degrees in Wolfville, 19 in the parking lot, but it felt like maybe 4 degrees at the end with that wind whipping at us. All in all, it wasn’t my favourite hike, I’m glad I did it, finally, but I probably won’t do it again.', 'A little underwhelming after all of the stellar reviews. The clearing is lovely and offers a nice view, however it’s a bit of a trot for such little payoff.

More of a nature walk than a hike, with a wide, well cleared and groomed trail from start to finish.

People say its the boring part of the loop, mostly in the wood.  But i really enjoy it, peaceful in the wood :)', ""This is a great trail with amazing views!!  I definitely recommend this trail, and will do it again next year.  As the distances aren't too long between campsites and the hills aren't too bad, this trail is suited to new and seasoned backpackers.  There are plenty of water sources along the entire trail.\n\nDay 1: Visitor center to Refugee Cove - 3h45m.  Took a short break at mill brook.  This section of the trail was well maintained with a few hills.  There are a handful of points that allow you to see the coast.  Stayed in RC1.  Sites 1 and 2 looked nice.  I didn't see the other sites.  Just past site 2 on the right there is a little opening with a great tree for a PCT bear hang. A short walk from campsite to beach with cook kit, made for a nice supper.\n\nDay 2: Refugee Cove to Eatonville - 8h15m. the morning was foggy with no views, but it cleared up by lunch. This section was definitely the most scenic.  There are so many great spots for photos and take in the views.  Terrain was very rooty, but not much for hills.  A few short ups and downs.  Around km marker 25, got stung in the back of the head.  Didn't see or hear any nest until it was too late.  Lunch at Big Bald, and a couple breaks.  Arrived at Seal cove(original booking) at 3:30pm and wanted to push on.  Called and change my res to Eatonville.  Arrived at Eatonville at 5pm.  I had site 1 which is a great site.  Site 2 right beside is great also.  Both are right next to a good section of the brook.  Had difficulty finding a good tree for bear hang, but as I was the only one in the entire Eatonville campground, there was a great tree in site 2 to use.\n\nDay 3: Eatonville to visitor center - 3h15m. It was very misty and wet, so I was motivated to get off the trail before the rain (supposed to hit afternoon).  The first and last parts of this section have a couple hills, but the middle is very flat (along brooks), so you can make some good time.  Although this section has no coastal views, it is quite pretty in spots.  If this was a dry day, I imagine I would have found myself stopping to look at the scenery."", 'The squirrels here really don’t mess about!! Hang all of your food properly as soon as you get to camp, they won’t hesitate to chew through anything your food is in. \n\nOther than that this trail is absolutely amazing!! We did 3 nights in total, doing it in reverse. \nParking - Seal Cove - 6.5 hrs\nSeal Cove - Big Bald Rock - 4.5hrs\nBig Bald Rock - Refugee Cove - 4.5 hrs\nRefugee Cove - Parking - 3 hr 15\n\nWe were really happy to get the 20k out of the way. Took lots of long breaks for views and really enjoyed the hikes on days 2 and 3. We were all warmed up to get the last day done quite quickly. All the campsites were really nice and the views here are just spectacular!! \n\nWould love to do this again, 4 days was perfect! Bringing poles next time though!\n\n', 'Fantastic hike! The trail is well-marked and maintained, as are the facilities. They clean the ""pit privies"" every 2 days. This was my first solo multi-day hike, and it was a really great one for it. I will definitely do this one again!\n\nI hiked in a counter-clockwise direction staying at Seal Cove, Big Bald Rock, and finally Refugee Cove. I wanted to get the long 20 km day through mostly forests over with first, although that left the most difficult day for the end. One thing I really liked about doing it this way was that you hike through forests all day, and then finally getting to the coast and seeing those amazing views just makes it that much more breath-taking.\n\nBEWARE OF SQUIRRELS. When I got to Big Bald Rock campsite, I dropped my pack and went to check out the beach. I made sure everything was closed up so rodents/squirrels/etc didn\'t get in. When I got back, a squirrel had chewed a hole in my pack. That night, the squirrels chewed a hole in my sealine bag which I had HUNG UP to deter wildlife from getting my food. I am very grateful to the other campers who saved my food from being totally ravaged by the squirrels. Hang your food, hang it well, and don\'t leave any food or food bags unattended even for a moment.', 'well maintained trail. did it in 3 days 2 nights. the campsite at little bald rock was nice and worth the extra kms. we got our campsite stolen at eatonville wich was a little annoying but luckily 2 other hiker shared a campsite and gave us one. overall excellent trail, lots of ups and down and lots of viewpoints. i highly recommend amd will do it again this year.', 'Another year, another fun trip! That last part from Seal Cove to Eatonville is so tough… I always miss and get high Tide. I debate going counter clockwise next year, but then I’ll miss the grand finale of the three sisters view… Though it would be cool doing the Eatonville day trails and getting more glimpses… The only camp I wouldn’t recommend is probably keyhole Brook… Every other site has its own special piece of the puzzle… I love doing this in super hot conditions. I was so grateful it didn’t rain… I did it in four days and three nights so I could really take it in… But in the future I might add another night on… Because I was in paradise being there.

I’ll post more shortly', 'Great hike from Eatonville Rd near km#36 into Sealy Cove -km#30.5... nice ocean breeze... just shy 12km in/out.', ""My partner and I did the full loop in 2nights/3days and it was very challenging for us, but a beautiful hike! Highly recommend, just make sure you are prepared. Lots of great water sources and lookoff points. \n\nRed Rocks to Refugee Cove - Day 1\n- about 13km when you factor in getting right to the site, took us 5 hours with a few breaks\n- The tide was in when we arrived, so we couldn't shortcut through the beach\n- intense inclines and declines, but this segment is pretty well maintained\n- I don't recommend site RC7, it's covered in tree roots\nRefugee Cove to Seal Cove - Day 2\n- everyone said this day would be easier, I'm not too sure about that. Inclines and declines were less severe, but constant and you really feel the extra kms! \n- Most scenic day, trail is right against the coastal cliff most of the day\n- be warned that off-beach sites at SC are up a hill from the beach, water source and privy\nSeal Cove to Red Rocks - Day 3\n- Seal Cove to Eatonville is similar terrain to the day before, we finished in ~1:45\n- after Eatonville things flatten out quite a bit and you're hiking through a forest along a river. \n- tide was out and the beach shortcut was a lifesaver!"", 'The trail ended at my last attached photo, I drove off a bit before stopping the app. Probably 1K thereabouts.', 'Excellent Trip. Elevation Tracker on this app is deceiving. Use a Topo Map instead.', 'Absolutely loved the trail... we have done it in 2 days stayed the night at Keyhole and split the hike pretty much 50/50... the first day was about 9 hours and the second day was 8ish... it was great challenge... definitely something i would do again! Only thing i would change would be staying the night at Seal Cove so we could have evening/morning swim but that would push first day to almost 30k... ', 'What a beautiful trail in Nova Scotia! Did the trail over 3 days and wished I had done it over 4. Also enjoyed the wooded part of the trail through Eatonville it was shaded and relatively easy terrain.

The weather was amazing, not many bugs that I noticed and the evenings were just perfect with the breeze coming off the bay. Met some great fellow hikers who shared there stories and experiences. Thanks Wade, Gwen and Holly...it always make the trail better meeting quality hikers/people like this. All in all it was another great and somewhat challenging hike.

Nice coastal views including 3 sisters', 'Redrocks to Eatonville campsites\nPrimitive rough trail, many blowdowns and mud bogs. Bugs were worst ever. Very difficult day and boring being entirely in woods.', 'Recommend beautiful, rugged black diamond trail run with plenty of wildlife (saw 3 deer and their constant tracks, birds,  beaver, and bear scat, etc). I ran it counter-clockwise. Very difficult this way leaving dozens of huge elevation gains till last. Loads of mud, washed out sections and fallen trees. I was able to run two-thirds of the trail today: power hiked, scrambled and climbed the rest.', 'Amazing trail! Completed it at the end of last summer. Challenging at some points but every view point is very worth it. If you start from the visitor centre and hope to make it a loop, the final stretch back to the parking lot is essentially just walking on a road....Would recommend contacting the park regarding a pick up option if you’d prefer to skip this. Also found the backcountry hiking camp sites fairly buggy and dark, opt’d to sleep on the beaches at the kayaking campsites and it was heaps more enjoyable!', ""One of the most beautiful hikes I've completed to date! Rather challenging if you plan for longer days, but rewarding nonetheless. 3 days 2 nights is certainly enough to complete the trail. We hiked clockwise and I would definitely do that direction again. Ran into 3 groups of people the entire time we were on the trail so it was nice and quiet. A significant amount of muddy patches to go around between Refugee and Seal Cove, but that could have also been because of the hurricane. One of the best marked trails I have ever experienced as well. "", ""Beautiful trail. Can't wait to do it again. Reserving cabins and carrying less gear was a great option I'm glad we took. "", 'Absolutely incredible views across rugged terrain. My husband and I just completed this hike in 3 days, 2 nights. We took a shuttle from Advocate to Eatonville, opting out of the 14k wooded portion of this trail. We started in Eatonville day one and hiked to Big Bald Cabin (which was such perfect end to the day). Approximately 15k, a couple of real good inclines and declines and lots of muck (we went 2 days after a large rain storm). Day 2 was Bug Bald to Refugee Cove (9k). This was the hardest day for us, as we pushed ourselves a bit harder than we should have on day one. We had a late start and had to push to make it before dark. This portion of the trail was very mucky, so wear waterproof hiking boots and take poles. You’ll thank yourself. There were some sketchy “bridges” as well. Watch your footing. Day three was Refugee back to Red Rocks (13k). Mill brook was both an incredible climb down and up, but the views are stunning. We timed ourselves so we could finish the hike with the shortcut on the beach. Despite the wicked hills, day three was our favourite. The trail had no mud and was easy to navigate. All in all, it took us about 15-16 hours hike time. Happy Hiking! ', ""Very nice loop with some decent ascends and descends. I did the loop in 3 days (with overnights at Little Bald Rock and Eatonville).\n\nThe trail itself is very well marked and easy to follow. The paths are clear and very well maintained. Along the coastal trail there's some roots sticking out which makes it a bit more technical, but still easy going. You just have to watch your steps a little bit.\n\nLittle Bald Rock is a nice small campground. Easy access to a water source and you can watch the sunset on the cliffs. For me, Eatonville was full of mosquitos so not very enjoyable. The campsite itself however was nice with a table and a nice stream to cool down in. Note for both campsites, the surface is hard, so pegs might not be ideal.\n\nFor someone who's fit and used to hiking (read: exercises several times a week, including running), this shouldn't be too much of a struggle. 3 days was plenty of time for me (hence me adding McGahey Brook Canyon Loop to it at the end) and I'll be doing it again in 2 days with an overnight at Keyhole Brooks. When you're not used to hiking/running, the climbs will set you back, so be prepared. Take it slow and take breaks when necessary.\n\nHighly recommend this. Good starter to get into multi day backpacking.\n\nI've seen comments with regards to dissapointing views. It is true, you're hiking in the forest for a substantial amount of time, so be aware of this. However, you do descend to several beaches, the most significant ones being Peggy's Cove and Seal's Cove, which give you stunning views as well as several lookouts along the way. To me, the best views are in between Little Bald Rock and Eatonville."", '9 of us, with varying experience and fitness, hiked the trail in 4 days with nights at Refugee Cove, Big Bald Rock (in a cabin) and Seal Cove (which was the highlight).  Mosquitoes were minimal, trail well marked but expect difficult footing at some points. While it was hard it was manageable by all. We’ve hiked in British Columbia and Alberta so enjoyed a chance to hike in eastern Canada. Highly recommend stopping at Wild Caraway for post hike refueling in Advocate for amazing food. ', ""2 of us did this in 3 days, 2 nights and took us about 15h of hiking to complete including rest stops.  We're in fairly good shape.  Night 1 was at Eatonville camp site.  Time from leaving to camp was 5hours, and included a 6km mistake we made by taking the wrong path at first, totally our fault. This could have easily been only a 4hour section and was easiest part of the whole trip.  Once you get out of that first climb before the tail split it's cake.  Night 2 we went to Refuge Cove, and this was 24km.  It was a long day, and we pushed really hard.  Took us 8.5 including breaks and lunch.  Then on the 3rd day Refuge Cove to Visitor Center was 3 hours.  We were pretty motivated because it was raining.  Bugs weren't bad at all, only got bit a one evening.  If i was to do it again, I'd go Visitor Center -> Seal Cove, Seal Cove to Refuge Cove, Refuge Cove -> Visitor Center.  Lengthen the first day, have a shorter second.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended."", 'This review is in response to Dan\'s AT ""cool-down"" comment: in no way should this trail been considered relaxed. In addition to the 2000m of climbing and descending, the 47.4 kms of this trail are technically challenging and as hard as anything you\'ll find around. There are few easy miles, with the trail usually at grade or littered with rocks and roots. I\'m sure an AT veteran would enjoy the challenge of this loop, but an honest and humble hiker or runner would not call the terrain ""quite relaxed.""\n\nI\'ve hiked and run in many place in North America, and that\'s my take.', 'Had an amazing time doing the loop with my dad. Took us 2 1/2 days to do it. The first day we did 12km next we did 23km last we did 14km. Beautiful views and easy to follow trail.', 'trail was in great condition\nhad a wonderful time stayed the first night at refugee cove and the second at seal cove. not too hard of a trail but still pretty rugged terrain as you have to climb and descend lots of hills on the first day.\nbeautiful views and well worth it ', 'We just did the red rock loop.  It was nice walking on the beach at low tide.  The walk back up the stairs and on the ridge line was a little more uphill than we would have liked.', 'Hiked this loop as a ""cool-down"" hike after just completing the Appalachian Trail. Other than a couple steep sections, the terrain is quite relaxed and the views are spectacular! Other than the ~15km forest section between Red Rocks and Eatonville, you get some stunning views along the coastline the rest of the way... make sure you leave time to take the short side trails to viewpoints and beaches! Very abundant wildlife as well. ', 'The reviews are a bit misleading for this hike. We wanted to do a coastal hike and this one matched the description perfectly. We hiked the whole loop starting with the wooded side. We knew it would be challenging but the whole hike was literally straight up and down. There is no level area. There were only a few clearings to stop and see the ocean and they were gorgeous but I really thought there would be more considering 2/3 is coastal trail. The highlight of this hike was Seal Cove, a beautiful rock beach with great scenery. Also the only place on the hike to get a break from the mosquitoes. We stopped here for a break but I wish we had camped here. This hike is a good workout, there are tons of streams to re-supply water. It’s 99% wooded views though and I came back with 120 (yes, I counted) mosquito bites so wear a net or bring double the bug spray.', 'Nice day of woods hiking. Trail a little wet after two nights of rain. Decent climb in the middle and high decent at the end.', 'Challenging terrain today. Lots of roots and mud along the trail. Still a nice hike with some beautiful lookoffs along the way. Beach at seal cove is an excellent place to stop for a rest.', 'This is a great trail for beginners for multi-day hiking. ', 'Great trail.  Mix of extremely challenging climbs, technical trail, and a handful of stretches where you can run or pick up the pace.', 'Super-nice and challenging trail! I did hike/trailrun it last Tue/Wed and was almost alone. I spent the night in Seal Cove; since it started raining, I decided to do the main part if the trail on the 2nd day. \nBecause of the rain, the trail was quite muddy at sections, but doable.\nSome of the look offs are superfluous but many reward with great views. ', ""Pretty awesome east coast hike. A group of us did it in 2 night and 3 days. We stayed at refugee cove the first night, and Carey Brook Cabin the second night. The cabins are very nice compared to a campsite, but comes at a cost (Id recommend them if you are struggling to do distance, or if its cold). There are plenty of rivers to get fresh water from so just bring a water filter. The last part of the trail on the north side past eatonville road is rather dull as it is a walk in a forest with moderate elevation gain. In our group of 4, on the last day I left from Carey Brook Cabin and hiked back to the car at the HQ (20.7KM), while the other 3 waited for me on Eatonville road for a ride. Eatonville road is a gravel road, would recommend a SUV, Jeep, or a truck to drive back there our 2010 corolla did fine though.\r\n\r\nMost of the trail is inside the forest, but some times popes out to rock beaches, and once to an open field area. There are some cliff jumping spots near the middle of the trail (10', 40' and probably ~60') jumps, but you have to time the tide just right so you dont get sucked out into the bay. During late August the mosquitos were fairly bad. There were plenty of people on the trail, and there is no sense of danger. Just follow Leave No Trace procedures and you should be fine."", 'Super pretty and fun hike! Did it in 2 days, 3 nights (Seal Cove and Refugee Cove). Hike to refugee cove was beautiful and challenging. Between the two camp sites was a lot more flat than day 1, a long but steady hike. Seal cove to the trailhead is a bit boring, you follow along an old road. Found out later if you ask, there is a shuttle you can pay for and skip the less scenic part of the hike.', 'Overall it was an amazing hike. We did the loop backwards. Extremely rewarding. Amazing views. Loads of looks offs. \n\nAfter reading reviews and talking to folks we expected the hike to be far more challenging. \nWe would recommend this trail as a pre cursor to the Fundy foot path (friends we did the loop with us and said the footpath is far more challenging)', 'Amazing trail with great views.

The first day we hiked 12 ish from visitors center to Refugee. There were 3 climbs and descents that were said to be 45 degrees steep and one km in length each way. It was a long, slow zigzag descent and an even slower ascent on the other side. With each down we knew there was an up coming. Honestly, I'd rather go up than down. \nDay 2 -we hiked 8ish km from Refugee to Big Bald Brooke. It was a spectacular day and absolutely beautiful scenery. There were some ups and downs, but not like day 1. The camp sites at big bald were lovely and we cooled off and cleaned up in the brooke right beside our camp site. \nDay 3- we planned on hiking to Seal Cove (7 km) but things changed and we decided to boogy out to Eatonville where were parked a car.

The trail took me 7.5 KM and 2 hours as I dilly dallied a bit to take photos and footage on my camera. \nI didn’t have any problems with ticks. \n', 'Beautiful evening for the hike. 70 mins to complete.', 'The rocks at the beginning were not too easy to negotiate but the rest of the trail was great!', 'So, the first thing you need to know is that google maps sends you to the wrong place. No worries, the local residents have erected some signs to prevent you from going down the wrong road. Just keep going past the last road that google wants you to turn on and, instead, turn on Hirtle Beach Rd. There is a large parking lot there and it’s fairly obvious you’ve arrived.\n\nThe parking lot was packed but not full when we arrived in a Saturday at 11:00 AM. By the time we left at 1:30 PM, people were parking up and down the road\n\nThe only crappy part was walk the first/last part of walking across the rocks at the beginning/end along Hirtle beach. It’s a rock painters dream, however. Do yourself a favour and take the uphill walk along the cliff to save yourself some walking on the rocks. It’s private property but the owners only ask you to stay away if the horses are in the field. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get to the trail proper. It eventually is a loop. There is an earlier point that looks like it might be the loop but watch for the yellow markers. They lead you to the left. At the actual split, you can go either left or right. Left is a bit more challenging. \n\nTrail is easy to moderate. The kids and dogs can do it but not strollers. The Hirtle Beach portion is not for weak ankles or flip flops. \n\nTook is an hour and 5 minutes to reach Gaff Point in the middle. Nice inukshuks there and a few spots to stop for snack/break. Some really nice coastal views along the way. Trail is very mixed between wide forest path and walking along slate rocks. It is well marked with yellow paint. Trail conditions are great.

A few trees down across the trail after storms this year. Not too hard to crawl around them though! ', 'My definition of the perfect hike.  The trail is well marked and offers fantastic views throughout.  Loved the different terrain at various parts of the trail - from well-worn dirt paths, smooth rounded rocks, wooden planks, flat top stones, and more.  The trail is well maintained.', 'Awesome trail. Hiked along the beach until we got to the trail head just to the right. Extremely well marked once you’re on the trail. We kept to the left along the loop where we hiked through an area of sharp-ish rocks with a gorgeous ocean view. The point is a great place to stop and have a quick bite to eat. The way back was a bit wet with a couple of tree stumps to climb over but very well maintained. There were zero bugs but it was also only 14 degrees when we did the hike. Can’t wait to go back!', 'I love this trail. The only downfall at all is that the first and last is a very rocky 1 km each way that can be hard on the ankles but the rest is great and probably one of the best hikes on the south shore.', 'Trail is pretty well kept. Absolutely gorgeous views but a lot of the time you’re watching what your stepping on (on a lot of rocks). Very busy, thin trails. Great for a family walk.', 'Has to be one of the best trials I’ve explored so far. The trail was easily hiked and the views at every turn were breathtaking. Definitely recommend this trial. Will be back again.', 'Great trail, beautiful sites', 'One of my favourite hikes this year. We went a few days after Hurricane Dorian, so there were several downed trees across parts of the trail. That made some parts tricky, but still passable. The views are spectacular and worth climbing over some trees! We did it with our two dogs, they did find walking on the beach through the pebbles a bit difficult. ', ""Wonderful views dry trail end of August, wear supportive comfortable shoes for the beach rocks and navigating tree roots, did the whole route in under 2 hrs taking time to stop for several photos along the point, if you choose to do only half the loop start on the left side for views if you don't mind some spots beach rock, someone painted yellow markers here n there for trail, can appreciate the logs in the marshy area that is needed during rains but personally didn't favour them on this dry day, the cliffs and mosses were beautiful and I would walk it again."", 'Great hike, lot of nice views. The trail is well maintained, Recommend going out at low Tide.', 'Trail was a great quick hike. From start to finish took me 1 hour 20 minutes with no stops in between. This trail is not strenuous but you definitely have to be sure footed on the beach rocks.', 'Went on 03/08/2019. Started trail at noon, from Hirtle\'s Beach parking lot. The whole trail took us about 2 hours, with numerous stops and a swim at Hirtle\'s beach at the end. Walk down the beach for a couple kms to get to the actual trailhead. There\'s a few options to this: Walk on the sand, then up the rocks, or cut onto the farmer\'s private property and follow the foot trail up and back down the hill. We decided to walk along the beach. The rocks aren\'t that difficult, but witnessed some people struggling with their footing. An information board with a trail map indicates the started of the provincially maintained trail. You walk in abit and theres a three-pronged junction. Two of those have yellow spray paint indicating the trail to follow (That is used as the trail marker). This is the start of a loop. We took the right-most trail, hiking the trail clockwise. It is easy hiking through the forest, with numerous viewpoints of the ocean. The third path, the furthermost left trail, is an unmaintained foot path that\'ll lead you to the so-called ""secret beach"". This trail weaves along the cliff edge, and you may think that you\'re lost, but follow it to the end. Once arriving at the end, theres an overlook of the beach down below. Access it via the rope. Could be slippery if if was a wet day, so use your better judgement. Same can be said for swimming at that beach.  \r\nI would say the hike is a 3.5/5. Not that challenging, but on a nice day its a good afternoon hike. Not strenuous in the slightest. ', 'I went at 8am on a Friday morning and there were 3 people at the beach and no one else on the trail. The volunteers do a great job of maintaining the trail though I felt a few yellow blazes could have been added. Gorgeous scenery though. Take tick spray and wear solid boots.', 'What an awesome hike. This trail is worth every minute of driving to get to. Don’t miss the unmarked trail to the hidden secret. ', 'Was a trail with beautiful views by the cliffs and on the beach.  Watch out for ticks and make sure you bring bug repellant. Trail was a little muddy in some areas but there were logs put down to step on.  ', 'Muddy sections need some upkeep but this is a favourite I have returned to for 14 years. I don’t have a dog but if you do look out for sharp shale sections on coastline portion of the trail. ', 'went with a group from the Hike NS Summit.  we started out in light rain which made the stretch across Hirtle Beach cobble a bit more tricky than the return when it was dry.  The spring rains and steady use of this trail made it quite muddy when you reach the wooded sections of the trail.  Having said that, my feet stayed dry and there were no big problems.  I believe this will be a great hike on a sunny day as the coastal sections are dramatic.  I did find the cobble a bit annoying and tricky to walk on.  Poles were handy getting around the mud puddles.  This trail is protected by the NS Nature Trust and the Nature Conservancy of Canada and the Kingsburg Trails Assoc?  ', 'Did the hike today. the trail is very wet and muddy ( it rained for like a week) there is alot of roots, so watch your step. the views are still awesome ❤', ""love this trail!!! haven't found the secret beach yet, maybe next time.I am going back with in the next 2 weeks."", 'great trail! I would rate it moderate for the uneven terrain  and some muddy bits ', 'A great day with family.  We really enjoyed the trail as well as watching the giant waves coming to shore as we walked along the ocean.', 'Definitely recommend this hike! It was suggested to us while we were visiting the area from Ontario in February. As many others said, the first stretch is along a very rocky beach but when you get to the trail it is well marked and well maintained. Beautiful views of the cliffs and water. We had some icy spots so I imagine other times of the year it could be quite muddy. We took about 2 hours from the parking lot and back with stops for pictures and views.', 'Great trail with beautiful Oceanside views. The first km or so was crazy rocky, so be sure to have boots with good ankle support. Would definitely hike this trail again.', 'A very rewarding hike with excellent ocean views. The first part of the trail crosses an eternity of lose beach rocks on the upper side of the beach. You should wear hiking shoes with ankle support - good place to roll an ankle. If you go in sneakers just be cautious. The trail itself is a loop with over half of it having ocean views. Good for on-leash dogs, however people like to break the rules which is rather annoying... parts of the wooded section of the trail can be extremely muddy but there are stones and boards to walk on to cross. There are also secrets to this trail. Find for yourself. \nThis is an area known for high levels of ticks so always practice good after-hike inspections of yourself and your pets. A good dose of the (pet-friendly) Atlantick spray before hiking this area would be recommended. Overall, this is a hike I go back and do every few years as it’s interesting enough to do more than once.', 'Great short hike with rewarding elevation changes, ocean views, a magical forest, and a few secret paths that you should explore. it is not EASY.. the trail requires rugged shoes, is very uneven in places, and the stones on the beach can be very hard to walk along, watch your step.', 'Rocky beach, gorgeous cliff views, alternating terrain, inuksuks, mossy forests, a perfect day hike.', 'Great hike, with amazing views for relatively little effort.  Cobble beach to start, check tides.  Follow loop clockwise for best impact.  Build an inuksuk, swim at a secluded beach.', ""this trail begins at a lovely beach with good parking and bathrooms! the water is great for swimming and surfing! \n\nwalking close to the water on softer sand is very comfortable and pleasent! when the shore turns rocky, head to high ground where there is a beaten path. otherwise the round unstable rocks make for a difficult walk for sure!\nthe terrain has many changes which really make this hike fun and far from boring! great views, places to sit on ground to rest/lunch, explore off trail along shore, break shale to collect Fool's Gold, swimming holes. there is a place to jump about 30' down into a good pool! but it's also a good place to slip off the edge as you are running for the jump, and break your back on the rocks below! this is also a dangerous spot on the hike for kids who struggle with being aware of their surroundings!\nif you take your time to enjoy all this little gem has to offer, it is definitely an easy hike for all. any hike can be made difficult if you rush !! \n:)"", 'amazing views. the walk to the trail head along the beach on the Sea stones is not fun, but the elevated views from the point are gorgeous.', 'Great trail.

We were lucky to have been able to ask a hiker who had just finished, and was able to explain what to do (the private property / no tresspassing signs make it hard to know what to do). We parked on the side of the road at the turn-around on Duncan’s Cove rd, before the pylons blocking access to the residential area.

The end views are incredible, but the hike in is horrendous. \n\nAs others have mentioned, Google maps marks the trailhead at Gannet Lane which is on private property. So the All Trails trailhead is where we started (which is also a challenge to find as there is no signage). I only had a “trail” for about 1km in, the rest is marsh and bushes. I followed the All Trails map as there are 0 signs on the hike, and it was knee deep swamp for more than half of the hike today. Maybe I went off the actual trail somehow? If that’s the case then the All Trails map is grossly wrong.

Everyone goes in off Gannet Lane although it is a private road. \n\nYou go along Ketch Harbour Rd. to Chebucto Head Rd. And then turn on Duncan’s Cove Road. If it is a nice day on the weekend, there will likely be line of cars parked along the side of the road. There is a house at the end with a “private property” sign up. Gannet Lane is a dirt road off to the right. There is another house at the end of that lane with a “private property” sign up. Here is where it is tricky to find the trail head. It is right by a power pole. I’ve posted a picture. There are a couple little trails that all merge together eventually. \n\nThere is very little bushwhacking on the trail. You are out in the open for the vast majority of the hike, so sun screen and hats in the summer. You are right along the coast so it is windy. \n\nThe hike ends at an old army bunker. Well, there is a long rock wall about 5 - 10 minutes away that you can see from the bunker. There is a huge private home behind the rock wall. \n\nThis is definitely a moderate hike with lots of ups and down. We did see some dogs and children along the way. They can do it with some help. There are a number of spots that you are right by the cliff so keep a careful eye. \n\nTook us 1 hour and 22 minutes on the way in, stopping for pictures and enjoying the scenery. 1 hour and 4 minutes on the way out without many stops.

There are various routes you can take (either scrambling over rocks closer to the shore or heading through trodden paths in the trees and bushes). \n\nIf you start on Gannet Lane then there is quite a steep climb down at the start of the trail. The start of the trail is clearly marked by a wooden sign on a power line just before the private house. \n\nThe views are beautiful in all weather.

I parked at a small turning spot where the Duncan's cove road and the Chebucto Head Heads intersect.

Got to pass 2 sea caves (could hear them only, not really see them) comparable to the Thunder Hole in Maine. No parts of the trail were muddy and was easy to find the way to the look out station as you could see it a few km ahead in the distance. This a trail we decided to leave our dog home for and I’m glad we did. My opinion: this trail is not suitable for dogs - extremely sharp rocks/rough terrain, thorn bushes, and steep drop offs. An accident could easily occur, however people seem to think this is an off-leash free for all. Could be a bad situation if an on or off leash dog approached another as the trail is extremely narrow in places, often on the edge of a drop off.\n\nAside from that this is the most beautiful and enjoyable hike we’ve done in NS to date. There was beautiful scenery at all times. My opinion: this is a much better and more diverse trail than Cape Split. The hike took us under 3 hours to complete (including two 10-min breaks, and a 25-min break for lunch at the end). \n\nNote: parts of the trail require a bit of maneuvering/slight rock climbing.

Can be very tricky to follow as the trail is mainly human made but definitely my favourite in Nova Scotia!! \n', 'Forced to turn back halfway through (before the reportedly spectacular ocean views) as the trail disappeared into a bog interspersed with pools.

A little tricky is places due to rough terrain and mud but that’s a part of hiking and part of the adventure. I’ve never done this hike before so I’m not sure if it’s always quite wet or if it’s just because it’s spring and wet anyway but I’d recommend extra socks and shoes for after.

Also on the way up, you will encounter SO much moose scat and a few spots of bear scat. I actually did this hike alone this time, and I admit, I was a little nervous. There are many berry patches and open bushy areas on the ascent, that I imagine would be pure heaven for bears. But I didn’t see any think more animated than a squirrel with a leaf in his mouth, peering at me in fascination, from behind a tree trunk. It could be I was the only person he saw, as there was NO ONE else on the trail with me the entire time.

A few bridge planks are a bit slippery, so watch your footing, and there’s only one muddy area to traverse. So very easy in that sense.\nGreat hike, overall!

Most of them however, hike to the point and turn around and return the way they came.\n\nContinuing past the point the crowd thins out immensely. About half of the far side is similar to the hike to the point. The trail is not marked as well but it is so open that you cannot get lost. There are several spots where high tide could create an issue with a dry passage. \n\nThe second half of the far side winds into the woods along the shore peaking out once in a while to the ocean shoreline but really never goes far into the woods. This leg of the trail is much more challenging with rocks, roots and mud. The trail is not marked but is very obvious so again getting lost is not a worry. \n\nThe last bit of the backside cuts straight accross the point back to the parking lots. Half of this is through the woods and half of it is through barren plains. Low bushes with spots of pine trees poking up. \n\nI would recommend sturdy and waterproof boots with ankle support, especially if you plan to complete the loop.

There are quite a few spots along the trail that are very wet and muddy. Also along the hike there are thorny bushes, might be a good idea to wear long pants if it isn’t too hot out.

Follow whichever one suits your difficulty level. None of them are overly difficult - I might recommend not taking your dog up the hardest/steepest trail and you have to walk up or down some rock face. Parts of the trails very very muddy - mud holes you had to try to get around. You scramble up the final section of castle rock.

If your items fails you while there, take it with you rather than being lazy and leaving it behind. If you must use th washroom, dig a cat-hole and burry your waste. Have a garbage bag for tissues. Tie and take it with you when you leave. Many people assume tissue to be biodegradable but it does not dissolve in hours. It will hang around for long enough that it will be in the way of others. The animals should not have the chance to eat this and people should not have to avoid areas where hundreds of people have thrown used tissue. \n\nThe scenery is amazing and the hike is great but the disrespect is unbelievable. PLEASE pllleassse be a respectful visitor before this land becomes inaccessible to everyone. ', 'Believe the hype. This place is absolutely breathtaking and worth every second of pain to get there. We are moderately experienced and average fitness, and this was a real challenge. It took 2.5 hours in, and 3 hours out. The terrain/elevation graph on here is well worth examining so you can get a sense of what lies ahead; there are many stretches that are unrelentingly steep with loose and uneven footing so knowing just how much longer you have to go on any particular stretch was a sanity-saver for me. Be aware that the trail is also one-person wide pretty much all the way, with steep hillside on one side. Tread carefully! On the outward journey, halfway in you descend into a river valley and this is a good place to rest, and refill water if you have filtration.  Things to take: hiking poles (or a good stick) are essential - trust me, you will need them. And take more water than you ever think you’ll need; my three-litre camel pack ran dry with about 40 mins return to go. And food, whether a packed lunch or a bunch of energy snacks, is a good idea. \n\nAs for the Cove itself - absolutely STUNNING. Meadowlands, hillside, beach, forest, rocky headlands, with a river estuary splitting the beach in two. We spent 2 hours here and easily could’ve spent six more. Next time, we will definitely pack (lightly!) for an overnight. It would be magical!\n\nThe horses were the highlight. Friendly and inquisitive, we spent some time saying hi. A little later when we settled in for lunch the whole herd came running over in the hopes of food - not aggressive, at all, but a group of 1000 KG+ curious horses can be pretty intimidating! We had to move aside and watch as they trampled our stuff and ate what they could; at one point, I had to wrestle my day-pack from one of them who had it in its mouth! Fun, but be ready for them. \n\nThe return is a killer, no bones about it. The descents on the outward route become the ascents of your return, and they can be brutal. By far the hardest part is the final return peak; that river valley I mentioned earlier? Yeah, you gotta climb out of that on your way back. It’s the last 90 minutes and after that climb the trail undulates steeply until the final descent to the trailhead. I imagine most people will be pushed hard by this part; us included!\n\nPack well, allow plenty of time if you think you need to take it slowly/take multiple rest breaks, and you will be rewarded with one of the best hikes in Cape Breton', 'awsome \n', ""Hiked this trail today - loved it!

Some areas overgrown, but only in a few spots. The majority of the hike is through wooded areas and relatively clear trails. The views and beach at the end were spectacular. Horses make it a pretty unique spot!', ""Definitely will be staying multiple nights next time. By far the most challenging and rewarding hike I've done yet. Steep climbs and beautiful views. Seals and horses in the cove. A lot busier than expected, we stayed on a Monday night and there were four other groups.

Lots of vertical hiking keeps your heart rate high for sure. Beware of cow parsnip as it can give you severe burns. Wear long pants as there are raspberry and other bushes to hike through. There is a small river crossing at the halfway point. Easy to cross during the dry season, but a springtime crossing would be interesting.

', 'An amazing hike and the cove itself is stunning with some great spots to camp. I went for the first time a few days back and spent Friday and Saturday night. During the day Saturday we went on a day hike, and returned to find that my new MEC tent had been completely trampled by the herd of wild horses. Poles were snapped, my fly was shredded, and the screening was ripped in several spots. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR TENT UNATTENDED. I wish someone had told me before hand. There was no food in the tent, it was stored elsewhere in a bear barrel. The horses are very de-sensitized and will bite out pieces of your tent so be prepared to set it up in one of the wooden enclosures and not leave it for long periods of time.

It’s challenging, with lots of uphills and downhills, beautiful coastal views, and lots of creeks (7!). It took us 2h20min one way and we did the out and back in one day.

They had the trail well eaten and beaten and now it’s a bit thorny and alders are growing up. There’s a couple of easy streams to cross before the river valley. It’s not quite as “open” as I recalled but still stunning views; you see the Bay St Lawrence the whole hike; even in the trees.  Lots of birds - warblers galore, and gannets. And we saw whales. Paradise. ', 'The most incredible hike I’ve ever been on! The hike is challenging at times - however the view takes your breath away more than the hike. There is a river to cross, and right now there is a small muddy patch to walk through (not sure if that’s always there), as well as some fallen down trees you have to go around near the end.

A great NS trail. ', ""My wife, my son and I are Adirondack 46ers and have hiked a lot over the years. This was one of the best and most beautiful we have done. It helps that today's weather was perfect - low 20s (Celsius), clear sky and modest humidity  - but it is more than that.  We were able to get to Pollett's Cove in 2.5 hours and it took the same time to return. We had been warned that this is an over-nighter, and it would be great to camp and explore the environs. That said, it is a wonderful and very realistic day hike for those with a bit of experience and hike with some speed. There are plenty of things to see - mountain meadows, deep gorges cut by streams and spectacular ocean vistas.  The trees, flowers and grasses are wonderful and conspire to create dramatic views to surprise at almost every turn. Then there is the wildlife. We did not see the mythic wild horses - maybe next time. We did see an abundance of pilot whales and bald eagles.  At one cove, far below us, we saw a coyote fighting with 4 bald eagles and a number of ravens over the carcass of a recently beached pilot whale. This hike has a grandeur about it and a remarkable feeling of remoteness combined with an excellent footpath. With all this said, anyone trying this hike should be prepared to work hard, exercise appropriate safety, be respectful of the environment and be properly equipped. There are very steep parts that can get slick, as well as steep drops. Beginners and many intermediate hikers will find much more accessible and appropriate trails in the Cape Breton National Park.

I have hiked this trail many times and will continue to revisit! Besides what has already been written about the trail's condition, I would add. . . . I have noticed that over the last couple of years Hogweed has started to grow along the side of the trail in a few different locations. Hogweed can cause painful blistering to the skin if one comes in contact with the sap. So (as always) be mindful while trekking along the trail. Also over the years I have noticed various amounts of garbage and trash being left around the Cove. Just a friendly reminder to everyone to do their part to clean up after themselves (leave no trace) and maybe even take it a step further and clean up other waste that you find.

L’anse est accueillante avec ses chevaux sauvages, sa rivière fraîche et sa plage à couper le souffle. S’il ne fait pas trop chaud, pensez à mettre des vêtements longs, parce qu’à ce temps-ci de l’année, les arbustes (rosiers sauvages, petits sapins, framboisiers) poussent dans les sentiers et égratignent pas mal. Quelques endroits boueux, sentiers assez minces et à flanc de montagne. Le pire de la montée se fait au début du trajet, après le premier ruisseau.

We would definitely rate this as one of our top five hikes! It’s not that difficult from an ascent standpoint as I expected but there are several challenges along the way; a very muddy bog section, a wide brook to cross as well as several other minor to a little larger water crossings (and remember that you’ll have to repeat all of this on your way back) and very narrow and overgrown shrubs- some were face height but I’m just 5’3”. What I did not expect was the most beautiful view after coming down the first mountain- totally jaw dropping beautiful; a combination of “the hills are alive with the sound of music” with ocean views. The horses were further back towards the river so we did not see much of them but the views made this hike totally worthwhile for us. I also don’t think that there is a need to spend the night in order to accomplish this hike. For a reference point, my husband and I are both 62 but have done several more difficult hikes in the past. ', ""Awesome hike! We did an east coast trip this summer and hiked lots of trails and this one was definitely one of our favourites. It can get a bit slippery and steep at times but the views and good vibes are worth it! The campsites looked like people haven't been cleaning up after themselves very well.

We set up our tent and went down to walk the beach quickly and came back to 9 horses eating all our food and beating down our tent. Had to make- shift back together but even through all of that this hike is 100% worth it! And left us with great stories to tell. Would recommend for sure, just make sure you are ready for a challenge in climbs and some very friendly horses.

See also my ""Hike In"" for the trek to Polletts Cove..............\n\nOn Thursday and Friday we hiked Pollett’s Cove, which is in NW Cape Breton in the Aspy Fault Wilderness. The only access to the cove is via boat or the narrow trail we travelled on. It is owned by a local lottery winner who generously makes it available for public use. The hike starts near Gampo Abbey, a Buddist monastery in Pleasant Bay. The trail mostly follows the coast line and is 8km in each direstion. It starts with a very nasty climb until you reach a stretch that is briefly flat along a cliff edge. It is followed by 3 knolls and then a steep decline into the cove valley. The trail is narrow throughout, and often traverses near vertical slopes and cliffs, often rough with loose rocks. The weather was hot and muggy. I would not want to travel these sections in wet weather as it would be very treacherous. The latter part of the hike had a couple of stretches through deep wild roses and other 6 ft tall vegetation. As we were staying overnight, we carried heavy packs with our necessary gear. In total the track had 2800 ft of elevation change. Easily the most difficult we have completed so far. The cove was outstanding consisting of a valley with a mountain stream draining to the ocean and populated by at least 11 wild horses who are very tame and curious about campsites. The night we were there there were about 12 fellow hikers staying overnight, all half our age. It was fun watching the horses visiting the campsites in hopes of food rewards. Among the horses was a foal who was still nursing. While in our tent reading, some visited us as well. A beautiful place truly in the wilderness. This was our first overnight tenting hike and we had a sleepless night which made the trek out exhausting. We were awakened by coy-wolves howling on the nearby hillside. On the trail, some of our fellow hikers came across a bear cub.\nWe will visit here again though we will be more economical with our packs which were too heavy.', 'Aug 2nd hike on a warm humid day. This recording is the hike to the cove as we stayed overnight. The early portion of the hike was a long and steep climb on a narrow trail. Most of the remainder was up and down good sized knolls also on a narrow trail. Overall a difficult track but very worth while once the cove was reached. We swam in the stream that drains into the ocean and camped in the valley. Currently 10 wild horses live in the valley and we found them very tame.']"

We followed advice from previous reviews to keep the app out so we could track our whereabouts - the trail is not marked at all and you will come to several forks in the road. We got lucky and found the falls our first time! It’s a gorgeous spot with flat land and shallow water access for camping or picnics. Our dogs loved it! There is a large gravel opening half way through the trail where there is lots of garbage from other campers, which was disappointing to see. Horseflies and ticks were HORRIBLE, but the waterfall was worth it! About 40 mins both ways. Beautiful views but some muddy spots after it rained day before. Bring sunscreen as most of the trail is in open sun. Watch your step for fallen logs and vines.

I notice red flagging tape through the clear cut portion of the train. The scenery is unremarkable and the waterfall is not a scenic as others in the book.']"

Ice cleats not required as there was no hard ice - it was all melted slushy ice/snow.

Trail is a short loop. \n- Did the Woodland Trail (although didn’t see it at first from the beginning of the Look Off trail - then found it a few feet away) back to the campground. This is a direct trail through the woods which saves a lot of time getting back. Trail was 100% snow covered, but was very easy.

Stopped into Border Brook Falls as there’s an access point along the road. These waterfalls are extremely high and lots of water flowing as it’s the melting season. From what I could see of this trail is mostly looked bare, muddy in spots though. Stairs at the bottom were clear. \nOverall, a challenging trail when starting from the beach parking lot and returning. For the less experienced or in shape hiker, would recommend starting from the campground once it’s opened to avoid scaling up the side of the cliff to get to the top. \nTook us about 4.5 hours to do but we stopped to picnic several times and we had a dog with us. We just took it slow and enjoyed it. Could probably be done in 3 in perfect trail conditions. ', 'It’s a beautiful trail! It’s a long haul, the beginning of the trail is very steep up through a forest over tree roots. Some of the little wooden staircases have seen better days, and when it’s mucky/autumn with leaves on the ground, it’s more difficult to climb up, but picnic benches along the way with great views make it worth it. After the first 20 minutes of climbing up the cliff, the rest is more gradual ups and downs that are a lot more manageable. Along the way you pass by the campgrounds in various spots, which means you have access to rest rooms along the way which is really nice. Further on there are wooden look offs over the Minas basin - you shouldn’t wander around the cliff side around these as the ground isn’t stable in spots.

Afterwards, you decent a steep hill for about 50 minutes before arriving at sea level with incredible coastal views. Note the decent consists of loose rock and dirt. We did not have poles but they may have been helpful. Once you’re at sea level, there is loads to explore. We set up camp to the left of the lighthouse, about 15 minutes from the bottom of the hill. It was nice and flat with a fire pit. There’s a waterfall if you continue further to the left where you can refill water and an area you can get down to a beach for a swim if the water is calm enough. It was about 35 degrees when we went so we were dying for a dip! Unfortunately, we didn’t see any horses however we spent hours watching the seals and the birds go fishing.

This was one hell of a hike for a couple of beginners (yes, we now know it wasn't the best idea). I have hiked the South Shore and Cape Split (mostly easy to moderate trails) and--woah--did this one hurt! The quads were burning. Both my boyfriend and I are not overly active folks. However, we both work at Michelin slinging heavy rubber all day on our feet for 12 hrs and I was working out at the time as well. Although I stopped often to rest my burning quads, I felt competent the entire time. The way up is VERY steep. This is NOT a biking trail by any means! It is a thrill when you get to the top looking down through the trees at the bay (and when you get to the top/plateau area/old road, KEEP TO THE LEFT!). Especially when you reach the other side of the plateau before your decent, looking over the ocean shore. This decent is also VERY steep and very rocky, many loose rocks falling under your feet. A walking stick for those who enjoy them is an asset for this trail! When you finally reach the shore, you get to see the mountainous fruit of your labour behind you and it's absolutely breathtaking! We began the trail at around 2pm and it was around 530pm when we got to this point so we took some photos, watched the horses, then began our trek back up (did not do the entire shore trail to the old ruins/lighthouse). We got all the way back down and to the car around 8pm just to see the gorgeous sunset! We drove a Chevy Cruze on the road up to the trail and our car didn't mind this at all, for those worried about needing an SUV. Yes there are some holes and it's uneven in places but I don't think an SUV is necessary. A WARNING TO NOVICE HIKERS: This was my boyfriend's second day of hiking for the very first time, which I DO NOT recommend to anyone! This is a VERY VERY difficult trail. I find it hard to believe some seasoned hikers have said it took them an hr to hike up and 40 mins to hike back down? That's insane. My bf puked on the way back up and had to stop MANY times, almost every 10 mins, often to the point of tears. My fear of bears and moose quickly turned into a fear of actually getting him up that hill! But I was his biggest supporter and I knew he could do it. Slow and steady--and he did!! But I had to carry both packs. Take at least 1 gallon of water with you. You'll need it! We lived and learned our lesson here.

The fairy hole is stunning and the views of the ocean/islands in the distance were amazing - big downside with the incredible amount of tasteless graffiti though, a shame really. ', 'Drove 2hrs just to swim and see the cave again. I will definitely comeback.', 'My husband, our 9 year and I loved this challenge. Definitely needed to use the ropes to get up and down the steep rocks. But the view and space is so worth it. We had a BBQ on the beach and dipped our toes in the water. We watched others take a swim and explore in the small caves. The trail is well maintained. Someone makes sure that there are drain lines in the ground to prevent wash outs and trees cut to keep the path clear. Will definitely do again. ', 'Lovely walk in the forest to a steep incline to descend to the water.   To go to the shore expect to go down rough rocks.  Some ropes are available, but caution is advised.', 'Great hike. Beautiful views ', 'Such a great hike, make sure to wear proper shoes as the ground is uneven. Once you get to the ropes to go down, go down and head right up a rock hill and the view after that is incredible. There’s a really neat ocean cave there as well for swimming. ', 'The trail was beautiful. Not too hard. Mostly an up and down sort of hike. The trail had lots of roots and rocks....so potential tripping hazards. The rope at the end was no big deal. A decent of about 200 feet or less. You really didn’t need to use the rope much on the way back up. It is mostly there for a sense of not falling. Once at the end of the rope you walk, hop and jump around the creek to descend to the bottom. Spectacular views. On the day we hiked it.... we saw descending the trail..... 3 golden retrievers and a pet goat. One of the retrievers had a prosthetic front leg.... so not too difficult. Lol', 'Had a perfect day on the trail. It was the end of September but it was around 24°C. Got in the water and checked out the caves.

', 'Lovely trail with awesome views! Be sure to wear decent footwear, as the trail is quite rocky and a rope is required to descend to the ocean. Make sure to watch for tide times, so that you do not get trapped if the tide comes in and you are exploring the cove!', 'Be prepared to drive on a dirt road for 13 km to get to the trail but well worth the trip. Short but moderately challenging ascent and descent on the trail with well placed ropes to assist. Great view and a chance for a nice swim in the cove at the end.

There was one section on the way back that was complete mud so everyone was trying different ways around it. I chose to step on a big boulder and took a nasty slip, which gave my knees a good bruising. My next purchase is a really good pair of trail runners and next time I'll just choose the mud (where my feet ended up anyway)!! I definitely want to do this hike again mid summer.
