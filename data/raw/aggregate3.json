Definitly touristy, we love hiking but not a super fan of over populated sights and this one was for sure, but was still glad we got to see it. Spot on the right hand side of the waterfall that you can climb up the side to the upper waterfall, was great for a swim ", "Nice rip down to the falls today. I had been there before so knew to look for the orange marker at the side of the road but some other people I met missed it several times and had a tough time finding it.", "Steep hill down and back up. pretty loose after a rain from the night before. overall a pretty good trail and beautiful sight at the end!", "One can not be afraid of heights !", "beautiful falls! Going down was no problem, guide ropes through the steeper parts. Coming back out made 50 meters feel like 5k but the falls made every step worth it.", "Enjoyed this trail. Appropriate nonslip footwear is a must (and wouldn't try this one in wet conditions) but this is overall a fun, short-distance hike down a steep hill to the base of the falls. Younger children probably should not do this trail unless they have an aptitude in hiking and will stick to the guided area. ", "Beautiful hike. Not sure I\u2019d have it makes as kid friendly. It\u2019s short enough but my 5 and 6 year olds needed a lot of support to get through the rope sections.", "Stunning falls! Recommend it for those comfortable climbing down cliff edges. Absolutely beautiful ", "Breathtaking is an accurate word to describe both the falls and the steep hike back.  Hike in (and out if you don't need too many breaks) is about 20 min either way.  Well worth a visit, the falls are absolutely magical.  ", "Challenging hike, but worth the steepness of the trail to view such an amazing waterfall! There\u2019s an orange stick the marks the trailhead, and I recommend wearing good shoes since its not the easiest terrain. ", "Hiked 11/4/19. Made a quick stop here. Beautiful falls, very steep short hike, not much else to it. If it is convenient or a warm summer day I\u2019d say it is worth the stop, but maybe not worth going out of the way for. \nThere is a wooden post on the side of the dirt road marking the trailhead. There is also a no trespassing sign just above it, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable... But since the trail is blazed and has the maintained rope section i guess it\u2019s fine... ", "Gorgeous waterfall and a nice steep af hike \n", "So amazing! Well worth the climb to come back from the falls. Wear proper shoes. ", "My husband and I did this hike today and were so impressed when we got to the end to see the waterfalls. Absolutely amazing!\nYou definitely had to use the rope to help get down to the area and back up the hill but as long as you have the right footwear and take your time, you will have a great hike and will be awarded by the beauty at the end. ", "Absolutely amazing!!!!  One of my top ten for sure. Short hike. Not for the faint of heart though. We saw many turn around and back out before they got to the falls - very steep and slippery descent!  Ropes to hold. Wear proper footwear !  Loved everything about this place! ", "great hike, worth the visit. wouldn't recommend for smaller children. it's quite steep and slippery when it's wet/raining", "Great hike. Short and it is steep going back up but the falls are definitely worth it.", "Short and sweet.", "just wow", "This waterfall is very beautiful and worth the visit. It\u2019s one of the widest waterfalls I\u2019ve ever visited in Nova Scotia. There are usually fish at the bottom of the falls, if you put your feet in, be ware of them biting your feet! Haha. Have fun on your way out, it\u2019s steeper than it looks! Remember, this is on private property and we are lucky to have access to this beautiful area. Keep it clean! ", "Trail is short but fairly intense (downhill on way in) with some steep sections (rope is provided).  Glad to have our hiking sticks.  Hand painted signs along drive in help but trailhead is easily missed (wooden post on right side hidden a bit in trees) except for cars parked adjacent. Popular trail as Egypt Falls are known as among most beautiful in NS.  Visited a day after heavy rains so Falls were full and trail was muddy in sections.  Well worth effort.", "Good to go down to and by far the most beautiful waterfall but very steep and hard coming back ", "SO glad we stopped here! The hike in is pretty easy (all down hill) but the hike out might get your heart rate up! Loved the falls. The water was cold but we swam and it was worth it! :D ", "Falls were spectacular.  Hike was a lot of fun. Mosquitos were out of control", "Trail entrance is marked with numerous 'private property', 'no trespassing' signs. I didn't bother with the hike as I didn't want to piss a landowner off. \n\nNov 12, 2018", "Be sure to keep an eye out for the green signposts that mark the turn! Very fun hiking in and beautiful falls. A little less rewarding climb out but manageable! Will definitely make a return trip.", "Very steep non-maintained trail. The falls are very pretty, not sure it\u2019s worth the climb back out.", "Good trail, rope to get to falls isn't bad. Ended up only hitting top of falls because we missed the split and ran out of light on way back.\n\nDefinitely would do again.", "Great trail. Would not rate it as easy given the steep inclines and the section the would not be possible without the rope assisting.\nSaying that it is a very worthwhile and awesome hike to a beautiful waterfall.", "steep decline into the bottom of the falls. three stages of falls to climb and swim. recommend.", "A steep hike but well worth it!", "The entrance to the trail is a bit hard to find.  Drive up the gravel road and look for the orange ribbons tied around a post.  The entrance is a bit past where the GPS will direct you to.  Head down the trail through the forest.  It can be a bit slippery if it has rained.  There is a rope to hold onto for the last part of the trail where it is steepest.  Once you get to the bottom you will be rewarded with a spectacular sight.  One of the most beautiful waterfalls!  I have visited a lot of waterfalls in my life and this one is right up there!  It'll be a tiring hike back up the hill but to see this waterfall is so worth it!!!", "To reach the falls, you must descend a steep hill, some of which requires holding onto a rope. It is well worth the trouble, but is not recommended for anyone that would have difficulty descending or ascending a long, steep hill.", "Beautiful waterfalls! The last part of the descent to the falls is quite narrow overlooking a steep drop and involves holding onto a fixed rope, which might not be suitable for everyone.", "I agree with Shauna...it\u2019s a steep descent to the falls, and then a steep climb back up, so if a person has knee problems the trail is certainly not \u201ceasy\u201d. However, the falls are beautiful, well worth a visit!", "I would rate this moderate because the walk back is very steep, not necessarily easy for all ages. Other than that, one of my favourite hikes in Cape Breton, I've been multiple times.", "Short but steep. Falls are worth it though.", "The no trespassing and private property signs belong to the adjacent property owner, the trail follows the property line and the owner of the property around the falls has no issue with people visiting at their own risk.  The falls themselves are incredible, and in August a cool dip in the upper pool is just what everybody needs before the climb back out.  The bottem section of the trail is not really kid friendly, but the County is working with the property owner to do something to make it safer for everyone.", "Very picturesque view", "Beautiful falls... nice wading pool in the middle tier  of the falls.", "Pretty steep decent to the falls but definitely worth it!
