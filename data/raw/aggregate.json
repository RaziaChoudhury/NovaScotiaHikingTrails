{"/trail/canada/nova-scotia/cape-split-trail": {"reviews": {"written": ["Great", "Did this hike on September 11th. First off, Alltrails is not up to date. The hike is now a loop as they've added an entire new section along the other side of the Cape. You can still do it as an out and back if you like but the new part has several new look offs added so I would recommend doing the loop. The loop itself is about 13k but with the added treks to the look offs it's probably more like 14-14.5k if you do the loop and look offs.\n\nWhen we arrived the parking lot was jam packed so be aware that if you're going there on the weekend and the weather is nice, it will be packed...and I mean packed.\n\nWe went to the point on the old trail and returned on the new trail. The old trail was extremely muddy so if you go after a rain, waterproof footwear is recommended. The trail was the same as the parking lot...busy. I'm not a fan of crowded hiking trails so I don't find that very enjoyable.\n\nWhen we reached the point it was crazy windy...like difficult to stand up windy. The views from the point are nothing short of spectacular.\n\nWe returned on the new trail which is slightly longer than the old trail to the point. Part of the reason for this is the trail is extremely curvy, winding through the woods. To the point that at times it actually seems unnecessary. But it is a nice trail with less mud then in the way in, but muddy non the less.\n\nThe look offs are a nice addition but are a bit disappointing when you get to them given the extra distance to reach them (3 in total although one was not completed when we were there). ", "Great", "The new loop makes the hike definitely longer, but it's nice to have a change in scenery and the new lookoff spots. I went after the rain, and the new path was almost as muddy as the old path. There was a lot of people on the trails too - never seen it so busy in the past.", "Lovely views at the point, however the majority of the hike is forested without views. The trail was also very busy (Saturday). With the new loop the trail is 13.3km plus going to the viewpoint at the middle makes it more like 14km. If you don't want that long of hike, you can definitely find similar views on shorter hikes. ", "Love the new addition to make this a loop with some great lookoffs.  The new/lower trail was extremely mucky and made it a little trickier but 10/10 recommend this trail!", "Very muddy on lower trail/ upper not too bad", "Love the loop. Great look offs. Really nice trail experience improvements!", "Beautiful trail. Walked it today after a downpour and it was very muddy and slick the majority of the way. The new loop was much less muddy, so would recommend that route.", "Nice trail, very hot today, so turned around after 3km in.", "Beautiful drive to the trail. The trail was somewhat hilly and rooty but fairly easy. Several muddy sections even after a dry August. The top is amazing and there are a few other pretty look offs as well. It took me 3 hours to go out and back.", "Beautiful trail, largely shaded until you get to the tip. Main trail is muddy in several places, as noted by several reviewers, so be prepared! New \u201cloop\u201d much less muddy and has several look off points which are beautiful and worth stepping of the trail to see! Bring lots of water!! Definitely worth the effort and would do it again in a heartbeat!", "Amazing views. A few muddy spots but well worth it. ", "The trail is in good condition. 13km total round trip. The first 2km are the elevation, the rest is fairly flat. The views are very rewarding. Would advise going early in the morning as the traffic seemed to increase at around noon.  We were on the trail at 7 am, no one else out there. ", "Excellent trail.  New section is very nice addition.  ", "New trail is great. Muddy in areas, but trail is new. Great lookoff spots along the way.", "Big rain the day before but great sunny day for our hike the day after. Trail was muddy in many places from the rain. Worth the walk once you get to see the view!", "Super muddy conditions this weekend. But overall a great trail. Very busy on the weekends, start early to get a parking spot. ", "Beautiful day out there! VERY muddy trail conditions right now - make sure to dress for it :)", "The ending makes this trail totally worth it! We went for sunset and the trail is clear enough easily manage with headlamps or flashlights. ", "Great hike.  Took a little under 4 hours. Better in hiking boots than shoes.", "Muddy in some spots. Bring a backpack with a picnic lunch and water and you\u2019re all set. Definitely worth it! We did it in just under 4 hours in and back ", "Super busy on a long weekend. But v lovely.", "WELL worth it! It\u2019s a bit taxing early on, as you\u2019ll do most of the incline within the first 2 km or so. From there, muddy puddles regularly occur, most of which are easy to walk around via an outer edge, others requiring a bit more fun, careful planning (be careful - it can be slick if you attempt to hop over any portion, and you may take a \u201cbanana peel\u201d spill). I found it quite fun, kinda of like a video game in dodging these little obstacles (felt like playing Crash Bandicoot to be specific. Anyhow, the view from the top is one of the most vast, amazing panoramas I\u2019ve ever seen in my life!! It was so windy up there that you could almost lean forward and have it hold you upright. The walk back is much easier, as all of that ascension early on is downhill on the way out. This one is an absolute must-do!\n\nAlso - I didn\u2019t encounter a single bug. Hiked it early August on a sunny morning 9:00-12:30.", "Excellent trek through the woods. It was raining H.A.R.D. the day we went but that didn\u2019t take away from the hike\u2026 great views at the end with one other look-off to the right as you go in.  Well worth the walk.", "Nice moderate trail. Not too steep but there is some muddy stretches at the beginning (even on a sunny, dry day. View at the end of the cape makes for a satisfying midpoint but perhaps doesn\u2019t justify the hike on its own.", "Great views from the lookout midway to the end of the point", "Superbe randonn\u00e9e\n", "Trail is very wet in some places. Nice easy hike.", "It was pretty muddy so wear proper  shoes.  Spectacular view for a picnic at the end", "Heavily treed, creeks running through paths, mucky and challenging at times with hills. Worth the view. Waterproof boots recommended. 9/10", "Awesome", "Great hike, the trail was quite wet so wear appropriate footwear.  The new path isn't open as of July 15, I would be very surprised if it is open by the end of the summer.  Great views on the top.", "Great hike\u2026not overly difficult (just long), easy to follow, trail goes through woods until it opens to a beautiful vista at the end. New loop trail still not open. Some muddy areas but fairly easy to navigate around them.", "well marked along the trail with how far you are. ", "Really really lovely. Warm in the trees but the view at the end is well worth it", "I admit, this ranks first on my list of hikes to date. This is one of Nova Scotia\u2019s majestic gems, overlooking the Bay of Fundy. The tidal action here is impressive. The trail is 12.1 km out and back, between 3 - 5 hours. We spent most of our time admiring the view and had a mini picnic with a beautiful view.", "Trail is mostly dry with very few bugs but many hikers! New look off deck is lovely. The trails for new loop are not open and are taped off.   Sunny most of the way but unfortunately foggy at the point. Will try again another time but a wonderful trail nonetheless. ", "great hike. super foggy at the end. ", "A long hike! Trail is covered in shade\ufffc. Great workout the first 20 minutes is rocky and a lot of up hill. Definitely worth it yeah ", "Great! frist time won't be the last! went with my brother and Luna. trail was in great shape 2 hrs in at an easy going pace. 3 hours out. massive amount of people. nice day. We went in early and coming out tge cars were lined down the road with tge parking lot cramed. traffic the only reason not 5/5 views and hike are spot on fir a day hike. and dine by noon ", "Spectacular dramatic exhausting", "A bit muddy and be for quite a long trek up hill. Well worth it though. Beautiful!", "Hard pack with some wet spots. A blast of a trail to run. Some nice speedy sections. Absolutely stunning view at the turn around. ", "Amazing.", "great easy to follow trail. bit muddy in spots, and good boots are definitely a plus.\n\n ", "The new loop is still rough and closed. Adds 3K and lots of rollers!", "Great trail for a late morning hike. Pack a lunch to eat when you\u2019re at the top! Perfect picnic spot, although it can be windy.", "Excellent trail conditions today, almost all dry, very few mucky spots. The new trail on the Scots Bay side is not yet opened; park staff told us the projected opening is not until August.", "The trail was in great condition after the winter. A little bit muddy today, but only near the front end of the trail. I was happy to see new offshoots from the main trail (official, not footpaths) including a new look off!", "A beautiful trail at any hour of any season. The trail is hard-packed dirt, so even if it might get a bit muddy, it\u2019s never too deep or unnavigable.\n\nThe seagulls roosting on the furthest outcropping are a beautiful sight when they wake up and start to stretch their wings.", "Really well signposted, but also well trodden so you can\u2019t go wrong. A great hike on a lovely sunny day!", "Great hike. Beautiful view. The first km or a bit more is wet still this spring. Otherwise perfect!", "Nice hike, a bit muddy as the snow has just melted.\ufffc we only did the 1st part.", "Super muddy trail but completely worth it to make it to the end.", "Beautiful views and awesome place to bring your furry friend! Was pretty icy during the hike, so would definitely recommend as a summer/late fall adventure! ", "Really great trail.  A little icy this time of year so some sort of traction for your shoes is a good idea.", "We hiked on Jan 16 and the trail was in great condition! Only 1 section about 1-2k in that was icy, the rest was just nicely packed snow, great traction.  Awesome day! ", "The trail was quite icy in places, and wet and muddy in others, but this didn\u2019t seem to deter anyone as there was a fair amount of traffic on this beautiful winter day.", "Minimal ice, great day out!", "Lovely trail with an absolutely stunning view at the end of the peninsula. Well worth it. \n\nVery touristy and busy on weekends. If you want a quieter hike, weekday mornings are best for this one. ", "It's a long walk, took me about 3 hours one way, but well worth it!  The trail itself was in good condition with roots and rocks exposed but a good mix between uphill and level with 2 look out points before arriving at the end. One bathroom due to Covid.\n", "Only mucky in a couple spots. They are building some new lookoffs. Perfect temperature: 15c.", "Great hike! Had a beautiful day!", "Great spot", "Breathtaking.", "Great! Slow and steady until the end", "Mind breaker", "A bit muddy on some parts but it was to be expected after heavy rains the day before.  Beautiful scenery from the top not much to see on the way up. Worth bring a snack to sit and take in the view.", "Great hike. Very busy spot today as its a long weekend but people were very curious and kept distance as much as possible. Will be back. ", "Fantastic", "Highly recommend this trail! Easy to moderate hiking. \n", "Easy hike. Only scenery was at the end", "Moderate trail, the view at the end of the trail is breathtaking. ", "Well kept trail! Beautiful views! ", "Perfect hike with beautiful view at the end. Lots of inclines to get a good burn going. ", "great trail!! we took both our dogs (collie & chi) and they loved it. couple must spots but easily walked around. the lookout was busy but stunning views! ", "Great hike day today. Trail is in great shape - the few mucky spots from recent rain are all passable by going around the puddles. No damage or impassable spots to report. ", "Recommend the trek up and back. Don\u2019t go do the loop. Too bushwacky so difficult for what it\u2019s worth.", "Very nice trail! Fairly busy, but well kept. Entire trail is forested, so it's nicely shaded and keeps the wind out. After an hour or so, we made it to the end and BOOM! Gale force winds when we reached the opening to the Split. Probably so windy that it limited our stay to about 15 minutes, so we hiked 'er back. All in all, took around 2h15m to complete at a pretty decent pace. Definitely recommend this trail, though! Surrounding area of Wolfville is always a nice stay, as well. Terrific area.", "Amazing hike. Busier than I expected but lovely. Tough in places. The view at the point is breathtaking!", "I did this trail in June 2020, it was excellent! Took my 2 dogs, lots of water. the trail was beautiful and the view at the end was spectacular. would definately recommend this trail. ", "Great trail, amazing views. Some steep inclines and a long trek but in the end, it\u2019s worth it", "Great trail well maintained.  Not too difficult terrain.  Took us 3 hours round trip ", "Beautiful view. Clear trail, not too busy when we went and didn\u2019t run into any bugs", "Well maintained", "First time doing a hike. Went with my nieces and a friend. First of all, I have lower back issues, being a person that loves a challenge. I decided to wear my 10lb vest. Thought it was a 2.5 hr walk in and out! NO!  Realized we were in for a very long hike. I was hurting so bad by the time we got to the split. It was definitely worth every bit of pain that I encountered! We sat and ate lunch. Took beautiful pictures. It was difficult going  back. Feet were feeling pain. But I wouldn't change a thing.....now I'm in love with hiking!!", "Nice easy walk. Mostly up grade to the end, wide path, some roots and rocks to stumble over. Lots of parking and bathrooms at the beginning and half way point.", "Whew! Hiked Cape Split in May and it was a great adventure. The forest is beautiful, lots of plants and flowers, and you get little peeks of the ocean through the trees. Very peaceful and dreamy. And then the end!! Super climactic, especially on a windy day. I came through the trees and then BAM blasted by wind. My cheeks were flappin! So fun! \n\nAlso! I encourage you to look up the Indigenous histories and presents of the land you\u2019re hiking on. Think about what it means as settlers to use this unceded Mi\u2019kmaq land for pleasure. ", "Great hike. Watch the weather as it can be windy and foggy at the split while being sunny in the parking lot", "Great view at the end. It was a little muddy in places but overall really well kept.", "Amazing. It was an easy trail.", "Beautiful trail. The hike is mainly in the woods and there are some very steep inclines. None of the 12km has a view of the basin or Bay of Fundy, but the view at the end is spectacular. The actual hiking trail is beautiful but is 100% forest. The paths are narrow so passing people doesn\u2019t allow for the \u2018Covid 6ft\u2019. There are some washrooms at the start of the trail and half way up. The half way up ones are in the shade so smelt slightly better on a hot day! :) ", "Great day on the trail. Lots of hills and a beautiful view. \nShould have benches for people to stop and rest and snack.  ", "Challenging but well maintained and marked path. Definitely worth the view!", "Took 4.5 hours (including exploring the cape, and having a snack) with a 9 year old that does not hike. Worth it, amazing view!", "It was a great to do this trail again although it felt a bit longer than I remember. Very quiet, went on a Wednesday afternoon.  ", "Great Hike... Easy to hike... well maintained! view at the end is just amazing!", "Beautiful reward at the end. Mostly wooded and hilly trail to get there but well maintained. Loop at the end is not a part of the official trail and is overgrown in parts. Try going on a clear day. ", "what a great trail. busy but lots to look at.", "Awesome hike today but watch out for the tree you have to duck under... I wasn\u2019t so fortunate and ended up hitting my head", "Wonderful hike, slightly busy. Beautiful view at the top and lots of grass to sit for some food.\nA bit of a rocky climb at the beginning but overall not too hard of a hike.\nMy phone died when we were at the top eating so this record is half the hike.", "Awesome Hike. More on the easier side of moderate. Worth doing the loop at the end. Nice and isolated from the wind and sun. \n\nWindy at the cape split look off. Bring a jacket. \n\nYou can take a little trail down to the water by holding on to a sketchy rope. \n\nTook about 3hrs of moving time including the dip down to the waterfront from the loop. \n\nWould Love to come back and trail run the out and back. ", "Foggy today but still a fantastic hike. Took about 3.5 hrs ", "One of our favorite hikes in Nova Scotia.  Hiked it today, including the little loop along the south side.  Lots of blowdown from last fall on that little stretch.  Beautiful!", "Nice trail, ran about half of it, I'm sure it's a nice view at the end, unfortunately it was really foggy for us.", "Super nice trail!! Took us 2 hours and a bit to complete the whole trail and return to the parking lot. We ran the last couple kilometres which made the return trip take about 45 minutes and the trip up to the peak was about 1.15 hours. The trees provide some shade but sunscreen and bug spray is a must! A bit muddy at the beginning of the trail but dry after he first 2 k", "awesome trail! it\u2019s a pretty easy one, just straight up and then straight down. trail was very wide and well maintained. it was windy but it was great because it kept the bugs off! dogs loved it even on the leash. 12k felt like nothing, took us about 3.5 hours to do it not including the lunch break we took at the top, and a few water breaks. ", "We hiked this trail yesterday and the flowers were beautiful! Loads of trillium. The downside was it was a busy day on the trail. 50 cars in the lot when arrived at noon. Because of the pandemic and social distancing it was not a good experience. Most of the hikers were collage age adults and were hiking in groups and walking abreast making it hard to pass at a 6 foot distance , so we were forced to step off the trail when we met them. They did not offer to step off for us. The older hikers that we met did step off the trail when meeting us. We counted 118 people while we were hiking. Also garbage has been left to pile up beside the garbage bins even though parks have stated they are not doing garbage collection there at this time. A great hike but not worth the risk at this time ", "Very windy once you\u2019re at the top, the view is amazing at the end! Definitely one of the longer hikes I\u2019ve been on in awhile but already can\u2019t wait to go again, all around great trail", "Completed this one in 2014 and is one of my all-time favourites. The 12km is pretty steady and not too difficult terrain-wise. The view at the end is inxredible; definitely bring your cameras! ", "Awesome trail with incredible views. There is a decent climb over the first 2km or so but otherwise the trail is moderate to easy. \n\nWe completed the loop at the end of the trail - and that I would not recommend for the less experienced hiker. There are a couple bonus views, but the trail is very overgrown and has a lot of trees down, making it hard to keep on trail in places. It\u2019s best done as an out and back trail unless you\u2019re looking for a challenge.", "Went on a cloudy day , the trail was not so hard and the view at the end was definitely worth it. But the wind was wild, have felt wind this strong in my life. Be extra careful while at the edge of the cliff.", "Nice easy trail. I did it when it was a bit cold on 19th March 2020 so the mud was frozen. very nice view at the end. ", "Every time of year has its perks. Every time of day has its perks. A busy area, but a classic. ", "Snow over ice on the trail made it easy to hike. Lots of water views through the bare trees. Windy and frigid at the point so couldn\u2019t stay there long. A beautiful trail any season.", "a friend and I hiked this a few yrs ago..its was a blast we geocached in so took us a bit longer..alday adventure..we loved it", "Very muddy, adds time to your estimate because some areas are slow to get through with slippery spots. Leave enough time to get out before dark. We will be back again", "Hiked 11/3/19. Epic overlook, but relatively boring and crowded hike to get to it. Hiked early, and saw no one on the hike out, but there were a handful of people at the overlook and many heading in as we hiked out. There were currently some muddy sections and downed trees in the trail, but all are easily navigable. The view at the end makes this hike worth it. \nI\u2019m confused by the reviews saying it took an hour or 2. It is over 8 miles (4 each way). ", "Lovely trail. With a great reward at the end of a wonderful view but there may be crowds including dogs. Oct 20th the  outhouses part way along were locked down that is not noted on the sign at the trailhead.", "Great trail. Only one tree left on the trail from the hurricane. Very unhappy about all the tissue and toilet paper along the trail. PLEASE walk off the trail to do your business and bag your tissue to take out. Think of the other users.", "Nice trail with amazing seaside view", "love cape split, one of my favourites! i\u2019ve done it a few times and loved every minute. last time it took just over and hour to walk, can\u2019t wait to go back.", "It\u2019s an ok hike...I probably wouldn\u2019t repeat it.", "Decent Saturday afternoon outing, took my partner and I 2 and a bit hours including a short stop at the point. Very busy and very mild trail. ", "We did the entire trail (minus the loop) in three hours. Quite easy getting around the muddy spots. View at the tip worth the hike.", "muddy. only complaint.", "Typically a very busy trail - but there is lots of room at the end to look around. Bring a sweater if you intend on staying for a bit at the look off part, it's always windy and little cooler there compared to the hike in from the parking lot", "I am happy to have done this hike. The view at the end is amazing and I'm happy I got to get out there to enjoy it in person. I am very impressed with how quick the storm damage (Dorion 2019) was cleared off the trail I would say right up to the 5 km mark there were obvious signs of work that had been done to remove giant trees and logs Dorian left in the way. Navigation and Terrain wise I would put this on the easier end of hikes, length and a couple of heart rate raising hills do definitely push it to the moderate rating it but for my self I guess you could say I was slightly underwhelmed with it as far as a challenge goes but everything else was fantastic. Probably wouldn't drive the hour and a half to make this a regular hike but again happy to have done and will likely do again if in the area or the opportunity came up. ", "Fantastic hike any time of day you start it. Trail is easy to follow. Expect mud, roots and rocks. I hiked solo and with 20 mins at the top I clocked 2.5hours. I was able to do this hike in trail running shoes. There\u2019s elevation gain in the beginning then  flat and rolling and back to very flat along the ridge. Great day! Started at 2pm out by 4:30pm 9/20/19. Love it!!!", "went the day after hurricane dorian.", "Lots of roots, watch your footing!", "The loop trail was very overgrown. Wear appropriate clothing and footwear. The beach is well worth a visit though", "wear good shoes and be prepared for mud! But so worth it! Bring a picnic and enjoy the views!", "Great trail with good elevation change, fantastic view at the end. Hiked in August and was busy, on and off leash dogs and a bit of mud but navigable.", "Hiking, rock climbing, and walking the beach, all within one hours hike.", "just over 6km to the viewpoint, we got there at sunset and the sights were amazing. The loop at the end is possible to travel however it's not really maintained (overgrown , fallen trees, etc..) its much easier to go out the way you came in. there was a little bit of mud in some spots but there always seems to be an alternate route to get around it.", "what a view! the trail is amazing, it took us about 4 hours to complete. 6kms each way and a break to take in the stunning views at the end. proper footwear is necessary; we went ealier in the summer and there was quite a bit of mud & water in spots. bring a camera :)", "Well maintained trail- great out and back with incredible views at the end! Enjoyed it very much.", "The trail is a little over 6km in each direction, so over 12km total. I was walking a very brisk pace and was able to get to the end in a little over an hour. Stayed at the end for about a half hour and took me about an hour and 15 mins to walk back. So overall I clocked in at less than 3 hours. The path is pretty much boring woods the entire way until the end, but the end is pretty fabulous!  I would not recommend this trail for small kids, or at least be prepared for it to take quite a while. Weather was perfect the day I went and it hadn\u2019t rained for a few days before, so there wasn\u2019t much mud at all. I really recommend for anyone willing to commit to a long hike...Although if you\u2019re fit and keep a decent pace, under 3 hours is possible!", "my 3 year old made it to the end. i only had to carry him for the last 3km on the way back.\ni would call this pretty easy.", "Absolutely amazing trail. Definitely don\u2019t need to worry about getting lost, trail is very well kept, big and there\u2019s always many people on it. Definitely a sight to see at the end as well!!!", "Literally almost the whole hike you\u2019re in the woods until you come to the end. But it is 110% worth it. \nI recommend good hiking shoes as the way there is almost all uphill. Some muddy spaces that you are able to go around. \n\nIf the view doesn\u2019t knock your socks off. I don\u2019t know what will. \n\nThe only downside is the loop you see in the map seems to be quite overgrown. ", "Hike was easy and flat for the most part with a few gentle inclines. Definitely worth it for the view!", "Wauw, wat a nice trail! \u2600\ufe0f", "Super muddy with all the rain lately but very manageable. A couple steep bits but my Alberta lungs has no trouble with any of it. Yay for sea level hiking!  Amazing views at the end and we had the perfect sunny day to capture them.

Some mud from rain 1.5 days ago. \nThe extra loop at the end does exist, but it is very overgrown, you\u2019ll get scratches from bushes ect, but it a fun adventure! No steep incline like shown in the elevation map, but still more difficult than mail trail. Views not as good either.", "A good long hike that features a pleasant forest walk along a well-maintained trail and spectacular views at the end of the cape. We took a deliberate but unhurried two hours to reach the end of the cape, an hour for lunch and to enjoy the sights, and two hours to walk back. Well worth the effort. Contrary to what is shown on the map there is no loop trail at the end of the cape (mid-way through the walk) \u2014 it\u2019s out and back along the same trail.

However in the shelter of the trees it was wonderful. The mud was bad. At one point my feet ceased being feet and became mud deposits.

At the end, the snow was almost gone; we had extreme wind, though.  I'll definitely run it again!", "I did it twice. Once in July 2018 and the second time was in October 2018. It was much more enjoyable in October because I was essentially the only one climbing up and didn't see anyone else on my way down. It was also much cooler and the trees were so pretty. I took so many pictures. It took me about 2h30 there and back and I was going at a normal pace. I am not an experienced hiker and I was able to do it ", "Love the view!", "Great hike, quite windy and rugged at the point made for a bit of a thrill looking over the cliffs!", "The view is totally worth the hike. The lookout at the end makes you feel like you are on the edge of the world. Make sure to take your time and soak in the views.", "Amazing views!! A must see, beautiful trail.", "Excellent hike,  not too hard and awesome view at the end. Also opportunity to take side trail to little split and do some rick hunting in beach or just enjoy walking on a beach where later 40-45 feet of water is.", "The complete hike is in the woods with little to no view until you reach the end, which the view at the end is overrated. Also, be prepared for crowds.", "Great view well worth the Hike !!!", "I run this spring and fall each year. Fantastic trail with an iconic NS review. For trail runners, it\u2019s generally moderate difficulty with a few more technical spots and lots of exposed rocks and roots-broke my toe on the way in a few years ago. A moderate effort will get you there and back in 1.5 hrs. You can really fly on the way back to the trailhead!", "Hiked the Split with friends who were visiting NS. Trail was in good condition although some mud and water in places. Hard packed with roots and rocks. In the trees for most of the hike and then arrive in the meadow overlooking Cape Split. Awesome view when you arrive particularly if the tide is flowing hard in one direction. We do this hike every year. Total hiking time approx 2;45 at a moderate pace.", "Nice easy hike on a foggy day. The entire hike is through the trees until the very end.", "Great hike for those of us who r not true hikers! Some hills for sure but lots of flats as well.  Just wooded views on entire trail ending with wonderful views.", "Beautiful vistas at end of the trail!", "First hike in decades! It was great! We plan to do it again in the Fall.", "This trail has enough challenging parts to make it worthwhile. I actually completed it twice in one day, back to back in 5 hours and 5 minutes.", "A nice walk through the woods. I took my 9  and 11 year old boys. They were tired at the end but enjoyed the walk. Went on a Sunday and there were quite a few fellow hikers. I\u2019d recommend going during the week if you enjoy solitude. Of the 12+ km\u2019s i\u2019d say half was uphill. Lots of stones and roots to be mindful of. A bit muddy in spots. Nice view at the end.", "Walked this trail yesterday with a couple of my friends. None of us are hikers by any means. The moderate difficulty is definitely reasonable\u2014 my non-hiker body is quite tired and sore the day after, and my friends and I took several breaks throughout. We took about four hours total. We\u2019re from Halifax, so it was about an hour and a half drive to get there\u2014 fun little roadtrip if you\u2019re from the city! The first half of the hike is quite hilly, but it flattens out during the latter half. View at the end is well worth the hike, in my opinion! I\u2019d highly suggest bug repellant of some sort, especially during this time of year. All in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend it!", "This is a nice undulating hike thru natural forest. The actual Cape Split was well worth the hike. \nIt took us 3hrs round trip and enjoyed the plentiful greenery and the beautiful vista at the point.", "Your average Canadian Forest hike for the most part, but it ends on an amazing view.  The local Chipmunks were also super friendly, allowing me to get some great shots of them.", "This trail has been on my \u201chikes to do\u201d list for years, but I always kept putting it off. The views at the end always intrigued me, but the descriptions/review of the actual hike always sounded less than exciting. I envisioned it to be too easy, I prefer a more challenging hike, but in the end, the hike was good, it had a couple good inclines and lots of roots and rocks to avoid. It\u2019s a long trek though,  we moved fairly quickly and it took us 2.5 hrs, but it probably takes most people 3-4 hrs. Bring a sweater for the end, it\u2019s damn cold out there! It was 30 degrees in Wolfville, 19 in the parking lot, but it felt like maybe 4 degrees at the end with that wind whipping at us. All in all, it wasn\u2019t my favourite hike, I\u2019m glad I did it, finally, but I probably won\u2019t do it again.", "A little underwhelming after all of the stellar reviews. The clearing is lovely and offers a nice view, however it\u2019s a bit of a trot for such little payoff. It took us an hour and 45 mins to do the first half and and an hour and 15 back at a moderate pace.", "Hiked several times while at university. Great in spring, summer and fall", "My wife and I where here in February, great hike! Super well kept and clean. Washrooms located at the entrance were open. Spectacular views!!", "Big payoff!", "Simply Beautiful.", "Trail is mostly in the woods the entire time. Not alot of trail markers, but it's easy enough to follow. No viewpoints till you reach Cape Split. Can get really icy if you're there really early in the year, and because of the ice build up, it'll remain muddy later than you would think. \r\nI'd recommend doing it to say you've done it, due to the popularity of it, ", "A great 3 hour workout with a great prize view over parts of the Bay Of Fundy at the very end.  At times, it feels like it's uphill both ways.  Very popular.  Wonderful time.", "The hike took 2.5 hours one way. Some steep areas and glimpses of the water as you approach the end. Beautiful view at the end. Pack a snack and sit down and enjoy the beautiful view!", "Great hike with amazing coastal views!!", "Went on a Saturday morning and it was definitely crowded. It's not a hard hike but there isn't too much to see on the way up. The view at the end was better than expected!", "great hike, beautiful view ! wear boots it's muddy folks!", "A great hike, moderately challenging, well maintained trail. Only upset was how cloudy and misty it was, was unable to see the whole view at the end, but it added a mysterious vibe to the hike! Still worth it!", "Great trail with an amazing view at the end!", "You have to go to the beach :D Best part of this trail!", "Amazing for us and our dog!", "nice run ending with spectacular view", "Loved this hike! The wooded area and forest was enchanting; old growth, trilliums, carpet of May flowers, moss and cool towering trees were a highlight. The end was magnificent, especially in the waining light.", "This hike was more than I ever imagined\nIt took approximately one hour to hike up the trail with no break. When you get to the top of the trail and see the view, you are in awe. I would recommend anyone to do it. Take your time and be prepared, bring a snack and something to drink.\nYou are definitely going to want to stay for a while ", "Very popular now and suggest going early. Also, walk in is about 2hrs through woods. only the end has views.", "Great trail. Give 4 to 5 hours for return. Stay away from the cliff edge at the end.. Awesome views.", "Amazing trail. Not too hard. Amazing view from the top", "Fantastic trail. Did this multiple times. Even once with infant carriers front and back. The view is always better then expected. Could be super dangerous at the end if not careful. Just stay clear from the edge and enjoy. Easy hike", "The five stars are for the view you are rewarded during this hike/walk. The view was spectacular! The hike there was more of a nice and easy walk, would make for a great jog/trail run.", "Nice easy trek with a spectacular view at the end.  More of a nature walk than a hike, with a wide, well cleared and groomed trail from start to finish. If you have time it's worth following the smaller, more rugged trail down the hill from the look off. It eventually leads to a lovely rocky beach that's often pretty empty, even on nice days when the rest of the trail is packed.", "easy hike on the main path with a fantastic view at the end. there is a large grassy look off at the end perfect for a picnic. I haven't looked for the 2nd path yet, where does it start?", "One of the great hikes in Nova Scotia, amazing view out at cape split. The trip is one everyone should make at least once in their lifetime. For a more advanced hike check out the amethyst Cove hike which vears off of the cape split trail. Always check tide times when exploring the bay of fundy before exploring the beach. Cape split is always a great hike and very much worth the long walk.", "Awesome hike! There is a choice of trails to get to the split one takes you through the woods along an up and down footpath of on even ground with roots, rocks and tree branches everywhere. The other trail takes you along the shore and is not easy. It takes you along some very narrow footpaths that are near the edge of a very steep drop to a certain death!! Once you reach the end at Cape Split you will be amazed!! Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful views!! This is a must joke for all hikers in Nova Scotia. Make a day of it and be safe!!", "Great Winter Hike, beware lot's of tree roots and rocks on the trail. Great views across to Parsboro and  the Bay. Well worth the hike to see the view at the end. Spectacular as the tide is going out. Must be beautiful in summer."], "key_words": [["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"],

Prefer to hike it spring and fall as it can get quite busy during the summer (even on week days).  Nice mix of rock face and forest.  The signage that differentiates the 3 trails that start at the same spot can be a bit confusing once in the woods so note the colour of your trail ticket (you will see these along the routes).  Great views along the hike.  The lake it runs along is swimmable (watch for leeches- bring salt if you plan to take a dip- the just lake entrance is a bit further down the walking trail past the mouth of the Bluff trail system.

Very rocky and roots tail surface. Well marked. No bugs when we hiked 11 to 2 pm aug 14", "This was a beautiful hike but was by far one of the more challenging ones I have completed, I would rate it closer to hard than moderate. The trail is moderate in that it is fairly easy to navigate and the slightly uneven ground to walk over branches and rocks most of the hike, however the length pushed it out of a moderate rating and into a hard for me, and there were points that could have used better marking too so you do have to be fairly comfortable with navigation. Despite it being a loop we somehow came out of the same place we went in which I assume is due to lacking markers towards the end of the trail, I ending up leading my self through the woods to the point I entered at rather than closing the loop.\r\n", "Loved this hike. Excellent variety in terrain with a nice challenge in elevation. ", "Great trail for running. Great elevation change and a variety of scenery. Bugs can be pretty dense so bring some bug spray!

Note that the full loop is 51km and not 44.9km.\n\nDay 1 (Red rocks - Seal Cove, 20km)\nThis is the longest day in kms, however the terrain is relatively flat for the most part. Not a very scenic day as most is spent in the woods. Camping at Seal Cove was great, we spent the night on the beach watching the sunset and my dog swimming. We had campsite #4 and it was good, the picnic table was nice to have.\n\nDay 2 (Seal Cove - Refugee Cove, 18km) \nThis is the most scenic day with lots of viewpoints. Very muddy though which definitely slows you down. The campsites at Refugee are really nice. We had #3 which also had a picnic table. It's a little walk getting to the beach though, which we were too tired to go so just stayed at the campsite.\n\nDay 3 (Refugee Cove - Red Rocks, 13km)\nNot as many kms but definitely more challenging with a big ascent right after leaving the campsite and then another big one going up an ATV trail. We also took the wooded trail at the end since we weren't sure about the tides, which gives you an extra 2km compared to taking the beach.\n\nMosquitos were REALLY bad when we went (Aug 22 - 24). Lots of water to filter and the trail is well marked. Overall great trail and could definitely see myself making it a yearly hike! :)", "Awesome hike, 9/10 difficulty, beautiful views the whole way along the coast. Lots of water to drink the entire time too", "Tough but stunning hike! We only did a portion of the park and climbed almost 2,000m in elevation. Loved it! So much so I am planning to do the 3 night/4 day total trail!! \nFinished with a 3k run along the shore in West Advocate!! ", "Stumbled on the trail ramdomly coming off of the beach. Cool views of the orange sand beach but over all hard trail. We didn't start at km 1 and had a hard time finding our way. There were no indications anywhere except for km's. So we had no idea how many km's all together. It was also quite a long hike before having an option to get out of the forest. Overall hard but I think would have appreciated it more if we knew what was coming and were more prepared. ", "An awesome hike forsure! We hiked counter clockwise, the trail was quite muddy between little bald rock and eatonville but the views make up for that! The two huge hills everyone talks about are wheeler trails so going up isn\u2019t to bad, it\u2019s just a long haul to the top. Tons of water to fill up which is great and the campsites are pretty good! Some have actual picnic tables others just have boards and stumps to make a makeshift table. Also no fires are supposed to be allowed on the backcountry campsites, so that was a bummer, but still an amazing hike, would recommend!", "Very well-marked trail, with some beautiful views, lots of wildlife, and terrain variation. As some other reviewers have mentioned, there were some very boggy spots partway through, but nothing that couldn't be handled. \n\nRegarding wildlife, we saw eagles, rabbits, deer, and frogs, and a number of jays. \n\nWe hiked the trail in 4 days, 3 nights. There is lots of beach access along many parts of the trail. \n\nHighly recommended for those interested in a multi-day hike. Remember that the tides in the area are dramatic and move quickly- keep an eye on your stuff if you have it on the beaches, and keep it above the tide line! ", "Tough trail for sure, but an amazing experience. Did the loop counter clockwise in 4 days, three nights \u2014 it was nice to get the wooded area done on the first day, and then have the coast for the rest of the time. Plus counting down the kms was so motivating for me!\nSome big hills up and down, and lots of muddy portions of the trail between Seal Cove and Refugee Cove. Saw lots of wildlife, and lots of friendly hikers and dogs.\nCan\u2019t wait to do it again!", "Did the trail in 2 days, 1 night. Hiked from Red Rocks to Keyhole Brook (26.8km) then to Eatonville to complete 36.5km (in lieu of returning along the 15km inland part). If we had booked earlier we would have stayed in Big Bald Rock instead only because it\u2019s a shorter distance, but no sites were available. Would recommend completing the trail clockwise since the hardest section is to Refugee Cove followed by the climb to get out of the cove. Occasionally felt blisters forming but with a little moleskin was able to stop them in their tracks. It would be a smart idea to bring hiking poles - about 50% of the people we saw didn\u2019t have poles and I was genuinely concerned for their safety. The trail is very steep and muddy in sections and the poles were everything in those moments. Plenty of streams with clear water so finding water was never an issue. Wore hikers on day 1 and trail runners on day 2 and it felt great to have dry shoes. Will definitely do this trail again, perhaps over three days or book earlier so we can travel less on day 1. Do your research before going!! ", "This is a hidden gem. The hiking was tough but the views were the pay off. There wasn\u2019t a section of the whole loop that I would have wanted to miss. Three of us did this trail in three nights and four days. Glad I trained a little! ", "Amazing but brutal trail. Hiked red rocks to little bald rock on day 1. Then to Eatonville on day 2 and finally back to red rocks on day 3. Lots of blister and sore legs by the end. Would definitely do it again just gave me a year to recover.", "Wet in spots and getting wide as folks avoid the mud. Need some volunteer trail crew to lay some logs and work on drainage.\nWell signed trail with great views of the bay of fundy (or sometimes just fog). \nGeologically interesting, lots of wildlife. \nOne of very few multi day hikes with campsites in all of NS.", "Definitely came as advertised!! ", "Completed the full coastal loop with my partner and 10 year old daughter this past week. Absolutely stunning views and by far the most challenging hike any of us have ever completed. We cried and we laughed, lots of great memories! ", "Wonderful long weekend trip. I\u2019ve done this trail both dry and wet, and in both directions. The trail is a bit rough in the rain but manageable. I would highly recommend!", "Did this 51km loop clockwise in two nights, three full days of hiking with a friend and our two dogs. We started at the visitor center and stayed at Refugee Cove on night 1 and Seal Cove for night 2. Highly recommend both sites as the camp sites are right next to beautiful beaches. Not all sites have beach access so these two are a must! Difficult pace for only two nights especially if you want some down time but very enjoyable of you're up to the task :)", "I ended up driving from New Brunswick Friday afternoon after work, and hiking into the dark. I had not planned my clothing well and was too cold to sleep in hammock so my dog and I ended up hiking the loop through the night. We were able to hear the ocean. But missed out on the views!! By daylight we were finishing up, signed out when lodge opened and slept in car for a few hours before driving home. Need to redo this. But it was a beautiful hike from the little bit we saw. It is longer then the site had said as well. We were happy to see the end when it finally came. ", "Amazing trail! But it is 51.4 km and NOT 44.9 as All Trails claims. First day is 12 km to Refugee Cove is a tough and technical section with 3 big climbs and descents - including one extremely steep descent - and ending in Refugee Cove. We spent our second night 14 km later at Keystone Brook which was a great site. We would have preferred to get to Seal Cove but because of a late start and ran out of daylight at 5pm and wanted to be able to see the stunning coastline. Day 3 was therefore 25 km back to the parking lot. It was a great stroll through the woods with a big ascent and decent towards the end. The trail was well marked. I wish they had names for all of the lookouts. Absolutely stunning coastline. ", "Trail Run - 50km Full Loop: \n\nStarted the route on the overland section to Eatonville. The trail was in good condition for running and I covered the first 18km in about 2.5 hours. The west coast section was quite a bit slower due to a combination of steep declines and inclines, lots of tricky tree roots, and skirting frequent wet sections but also beach visits, photo ops, snack breaks, view points, etc. It is absolutely beautiful on the west coast section. I was about 4.5 hours on this section. As soon as I turned the corner at the cape the trail running conditions improved and I was able to maintain a decent pace except for the steep climbs out of Refugee Cove and Mill Creek. \n\nTotal time for the full loop 9hrs 10min. \n\nWater: there were lots of places to get water along the route. I drank directly from streams the whole way. ", "Really great time! I did this around the middle of July and there wasn\u2019t one mosquito or black fly! \n\nRed rocks-Refugee Cove\nRefugee Cove-Seal Cove\nSeal Cove-Eatonville\n\nRefugee was my favourite place. Tide was out so I explored to the right of the beach and took in all of the wonderful cliffs and rocks. Stayed at site one at both camp sites and those were both good spots. Lots of places for water which is lovely. I\u2019d consider doing this in 3 nights, 4 days next time to thoroughly enjoy it. ", "Longest day for me, the part missing on my recording...forgot on pause!!   People say its the boring part of the loop, mostly in the wood.  But i really enjoy it, peaceful in the wood :)", "This is a great trail with amazing views!!  I definitely recommend this trail, and will do it again next year.  As the distances aren't too long between campsites and the hills aren't too bad, this trail is suited to new and seasoned backpackers.  There are plenty of water sources along the entire trail.\n\nDay 1: Visitor center to Refugee Cove - 3h45m.  Took a short break at mill brook.  This section of the trail was well maintained with a few hills.  There are a handful of points that allow you to see the coast.  Stayed in RC1.  Sites 1 and 2 looked nice.  I didn't see the other sites.  Just past site 2 on the right there is a little opening with a great tree for a PCT bear hang. A short walk from campsite to beach with cook kit, made for a nice supper.\n\nDay 2: Refugee Cove to Eatonville - 8h15m. the morning was foggy with no views, but it cleared up by lunch. This section was definitely the most scenic.  There are so many great spots for photos and take in the views.  Terrain was very rooty, but not much for hills.  A few short ups and downs.  Around km marker 25, got stung in the back of the head.  Didn't see or hear any nest until it was too late.  Lunch at Big Bald, and a couple breaks.  Arrived at Seal cove(original booking) at 3:30pm and wanted to push on.  Called and change my res to Eatonville.  Arrived at Eatonville at 5pm.  I had site 1 which is a great site.  Site 2 right beside is great also.  Both are right next to a good section of the brook.  Had difficulty finding a good tree for bear hang, but as I was the only one in the entire Eatonville campground, there was a great tree in site 2 to use.\n\nDay 3: Eatonville to visitor center - 3h15m. It was very misty and wet, so I was motivated to get off the trail before the rain (supposed to hit afternoon).  The first and last parts of this section have a couple hills, but the middle is very flat (along brooks), so you can make some good time.  Although this section has no coastal views, it is quite pretty in spots.  If this was a dry day, I imagine I would have found myself stopping to look at the scenery.", "The squirrels here really don\u2019t mess about!! Hang all of your food properly as soon as you get to camp, they won\u2019t hesitate to chew through anything your food is in. \n\nOther than that this trail is absolutely amazing!! We did 3 nights in total, doing it in reverse. \nParking - Seal Cove - 6.5 hrs\nSeal Cove - Big Bald Rock - 4.5hrs\nBig Bald Rock - Refugee Cove - 4.5 hrs\nRefugee Cove - Parking - 3 hr 15\n\nWe were really happy to get the 20k out of the way. Took lots of long breaks for views and really enjoyed the hikes on days 2 and 3. We were all warmed up to get the last day done quite quickly. All the campsites were really nice and the views here are just spectacular!! \n\nWould love to do this again, 4 days was perfect! Bringing poles next time though!\n\n", "Fantastic hike! The trail is well-marked and maintained, as are the facilities. They clean the \"pit privies\" every 2 days. This was my first solo multi-day hike, and it was a really great one for it. I will definitely do this one again!\n\nI hiked in a counter-clockwise direction staying at Seal Cove, Big Bald Rock, and finally Refugee Cove. I wanted to get the long 20 km day through mostly forests over with first, although that left the most difficult day for the end. One thing I really liked about doing it this way was that you hike through forests all day, and then finally getting to the coast and seeing those amazing views just makes it that much more breath-taking.\n\nBEWARE OF SQUIRRELS. When I got to Big Bald Rock campsite, I dropped my pack and went to check out the beach. I made sure everything was closed up so rodents/squirrels/etc didn't get in. When I got back, a squirrel had chewed a hole in my pack. That night, the squirrels chewed a hole in my sealine bag which I had HUNG UP to deter wildlife from getting my food. I am very grateful to the other campers who saved my food from being totally ravaged by the squirrels. Hang your food, hang it well, and don't leave any food or food bags unattended even for a moment.", "well maintained trail. did it in 3 days 2 nights. the campsite at little bald rock was nice and worth the extra kms. we got our campsite stolen at eatonville wich was a little annoying but luckily 2 other hiker shared a campsite and gave us one. overall excellent trail, lots of ups and down and lots of viewpoints. i highly recommend amd will do it again this year.", "Another year, another fun trip! That last part from Seal Cove to Eatonville is so tough\u2026 I always miss and get high Tide. I debate going counter clockwise next year, but then I\u2019ll miss the grand finale of the three sisters view\u2026 Though it would be cool doing the Eatonville day trails and getting more glimpses\u2026 The only camp I wouldn\u2019t recommend is probably keyhole Brook\u2026 Every other site has its own special piece of the puzzle\u2026 I love doing this in super hot conditions. I was so grateful it didn\u2019t rain\u2026 I did it in four days and three nights so I could really take it in\u2026 But in the future I might add another night on\u2026 Because I was in paradise being there.

Lots of great water sources and lookoff points. \n\nRed Rocks to Refugee Cove - Day 1\n- about 13km when you factor in getting right to the site, took us 5 hours with a few breaks\n- The tide was in when we arrived, so we couldn't shortcut through the beach\n- intense inclines and declines, but this segment is pretty well maintained\n- I don't recommend site RC7, it's covered in tree roots\nRefugee Cove to Seal Cove - Day 2\n- everyone said this day would be easier, I'm not too sure about that.

Only thing i would change would be staying the night at Seal Cove so we could have evening/morning swim but that would push first day to almost 30k... ", "What a beautiful trail in Nova Scotia!

The weather was amazing, not many bugs that I noticed and the evenings were just perfect with the breeze coming off the bay. Met some great fellow hikers who shared there stories and experiences. Thanks Wade, Gwen and Holly...it always make the trail better meeting quality hikers/people like this. All in all it was another great and somewhat challenging hike.

Very difficult day and boring being entirely in woods.", "Recommend beautiful, rugged black diamond trail run with plenty of wildlife (saw 3 deer and their constant tracks, birds,  beaver, and bear scat, etc). I ran it counter-clockwise. Very difficult this way leaving dozens of huge elevation gains till last. Loads of mud, washed out sections and fallen trees. I was able to run two-thirds of the trail today: power hiked, scrambled and climbed the rest.", "Amazing trail! Completed it at the end of last summer. Challenging at some points but every view point is very worth it. If you start from the visitor centre and hope to make it a loop, the final stretch back to the parking lot is essentially just walking on a road....Would recommend contacting the park regarding a pick up option if you\u2019d prefer to skip this. Also found the backcountry hiking camp sites fairly buggy and dark, opt\u2019d to sleep on the beaches at the kayaking campsites and it was heaps more enjoyable!", "One of the most beautiful hikes I've completed to date! Rather challenging if you plan for longer days, but rewarding nonetheless. 3 days 2 nights is certainly enough to complete the trail. We hiked clockwise and I would definitely do that direction again. Ran into 3 groups of people the entire time we were on the trail so it was nice and quiet. A significant amount of muddy patches to go around between Refugee and Seal Cove, but that could have also been because of the hurricane. One of the best marked trails I have ever experienced as well. ", "Beautiful trail. Can't wait to do it again. Reserving cabins and carrying less gear was a great option I'm glad we took. ", "Absolutely incredible views across rugged terrain. My husband and I just completed this hike in 3 days, 2 nights. We took a shuttle from Advocate to Eatonville, opting out of the 14k wooded portion of this trail. We started in Eatonville day one and hiked to Big Bald Cabin (which was such perfect end to the day). Approximately 15k, a couple of real good inclines and declines and lots of muck (we went 2 days after a large rain storm). Day 2 was Bug Bald to Refugee Cove (9k). This was the hardest day for us, as we pushed ourselves a bit harder than we should have on day one. We had a late start and had to push to make it before dark. This portion of the trail was very mucky, so wear waterproof hiking boots and take poles. You\u2019ll thank yourself. There were some sketchy \u201cbridges\u201d as well. Watch your footing. Day three was Refugee back to Red Rocks (13k). Mill brook was both an incredible climb down and up, but the views are stunning. We timed ourselves so we could finish the hike with the shortcut on the beach. Despite the wicked hills, day three was our favourite. The trail had no mud and was easy to navigate. All in all, it took us about 15-16 hours hike time. Happy Hiking! ", "Very nice loop with some decent ascends and descends. I did the loop in 3 days (with overnights at Little Bald Rock and Eatonville).\n\nThe trail itself is very well marked and easy to follow. The paths are clear and very well maintained. Along the coastal trail there's some roots sticking out which makes it a bit more technical, but still easy going. You just have to watch your steps a little bit.\n\nLittle Bald Rock is a nice small campground. Easy access to a water source and you can watch the sunset on the cliffs. For me, Eatonville was full of mosquitos so not very enjoyable. The campsite itself however was nice with a table and a nice stream to cool down in. Note for both campsites, the surface is hard, so pegs might not be ideal.\n\nFor someone who's fit and used to hiking (read: exercises several times a week, including running), this shouldn't be too much of a struggle. 3 days was plenty of time for me (hence me adding McGahey Brook Canyon Loop to it at the end) and I'll be doing it again in 2 days with an overnight at Keyhole Brooks. When you're not used to hiking/running, the climbs will set you back, so be prepared. Take it slow and take breaks when necessary.\n\nHighly recommend this. Good starter to get into multi day backpacking.\n\nI've seen comments with regards to dissapointing views. It is true, you're hiking in the forest for a substantial amount of time, so be aware of this. However, you do descend to several beaches, the most significant ones being Peggy's Cove and Seal's Cove, which give you stunning views as well as several lookouts along the way. To me, the best views are in between Little Bald Rock and Eatonville.", "9 of us, with varying experience and fitness, hiked the trail in 4 days with nights at Refugee Cove, Big Bald Rock (in a cabin) and Seal Cove (which was the highlight).  Mosquitoes were minimal, trail well marked but expect difficult footing at some points. While it was hard it was manageable by all. We\u2019ve hiked in British Columbia and Alberta so enjoyed a chance to hike in eastern Canada. Highly recommend stopping at Wild Caraway for post hike refueling in Advocate for amazing food. ", "2 of us did this in 3 days, 2 nights and took us about 15h of hiking to complete including rest stops.  We're in fairly good shape.  Night 1 was at Eatonville camp site.  Time from leaving to camp was 5hours, and included a 6km mistake we made by taking the wrong path at first, totally our fault. This could have easily been only a 4hour section and was easiest part of the whole trip.  Once you get out of that first climb before the tail split it's cake.  Night 2 we went to Refuge Cove, and this was 24km.  It was a long day, and we pushed really hard.  Took us 8.5 including breaks and lunch.  Then on the 3rd day Refuge Cove to Visitor Center was 3 hours.  We were pretty motivated because it was raining.  Bugs weren't bad at all, only got bit a one evening.  If i was to do it again, I'd go Visitor Center -> Seal Cove, Seal Cove to Refuge Cove, Refuge Cove -> Visitor Center.  Lengthen the first day, have a shorter second.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.", "This review is in response to Dan's AT \"cool-down\" comment: in no way should this trail been considered relaxed. In addition to the 2000m of climbing and descending, the 47.4 kms of this trail are technically challenging and as hard as anything you'll find around. There are few easy miles, with the trail usually at grade or littered with rocks and roots. I'm sure an AT veteran would enjoy the challenge of this loop, but an honest and humble hiker or runner would not call the terrain \"quite relaxed.\"\n\nI've hiked and run in many place in North America, and that's my take.", "Had an amazing time doing the loop with my dad. Took us 2 1/2 days to do it. The first day we did 12km next we did 23km last we did 14km. Beautiful views and easy to follow trail.", "trail was in great condition\nhad a wonderful time stayed the first night at refugee cove and the second at seal cove. not too hard of a trail but still pretty rugged terrain as you have to climb and descend lots of hills on the first day.\nbeautiful views and well worth it ", "We just did the red rock loop.  It was nice walking on the beach at low tide.  The walk back up the stairs and on the ridge line was a little more uphill than we would have liked.", "Hiked this loop as a \"cool-down\" hike after just completing the Appalachian Trail. Other than a couple steep sections, the terrain is quite relaxed and the views are spectacular! Other than the ~15km forest section between Red Rocks and Eatonville, you get some stunning views along the coastline the rest of the way... make sure you leave time to take the short side trails to viewpoints and beaches! Very abundant wildlife as well. ", "The reviews are a bit misleading for this hike. We wanted to do a coastal hike and this one matched the description perfectly. We hiked the whole loop starting with the wooded side. We knew it would be challenging but the whole hike was literally straight up and down. There is no level area. There were only a few clearings to stop and see the ocean and they were gorgeous but I really thought there would be more considering 2/3 is coastal trail. The highlight of this hike was Seal Cove, a beautiful rock beach with great scenery. Also the only place on the hike to get a break from the mosquitoes. We stopped here for a break but I wish we had camped here. This hike is a good workout, there are tons of streams to re-supply water. It\u2019s 99% wooded views though and I came back with 120 (yes, I counted) mosquito bites so wear a net or bring double the bug spray.", "Nice day of woods hiking. Trail a little wet after two nights of rain. Decent climb in the middle and high decent at the end.", "Challenging terrain today. Lots of roots and mud along the trail. Still a nice hike with some beautiful lookoffs along the way. Beach at seal cove is an excellent place to stop for a rest.", "This is a great trail for beginners for multi-day hiking. ", "Great trail.  Mix of extremely challenging climbs, technical trail, and a handful of stretches where you can run or pick up the pace.", "Super-nice and challenging trail! I did hike/trailrun it last Tue/Wed and was almost alone. I spent the night in Seal Cove; since it started raining, I decided to do the main part if the trail on the 2nd day. \nBecause of the rain, the trail was quite muddy at sections, but doable.\nSome of the look offs are superfluous but many reward with great views. ", "Pretty awesome east coast hike. A group of us did it in 2 night and 3 days. We stayed at refugee cove the first night, and Carey Brook Cabin the second night. The cabins are very nice compared to a campsite, but comes at a cost (Id recommend them if you are struggling to do distance, or if its cold). There are plenty of rivers to get fresh water from so just bring a water filter. The last part of the trail on the north side past eatonville road is rather dull as it is a walk in a forest with moderate elevation gain. In our group of 4, on the last day I left from Carey Brook Cabin and hiked back to the car at the HQ (20.7KM), while the other 3 waited for me on Eatonville road for a ride. Eatonville road is a gravel road, would recommend a SUV, Jeep, or a truck to drive back there our 2010 corolla did fine though.\r\n\r\nMost of the trail is inside the forest, but some times popes out to rock beaches, and once to an open field area. There are some cliff jumping spots near the middle of the trail (10', 40' and probably ~60') jumps, but you have to time the tide just right so you dont get sucked out into the bay. During late August the mosquitos were fairly bad. There were plenty of people on the trail, and there is no sense of danger. Just follow Leave No Trace procedures and you should be fine.", "Super pretty and fun hike! Did it in 2 days, 3 nights (Seal Cove and Refugee Cove). Hike to refugee cove was beautiful and challenging. Between the two camp sites was a lot more flat than day 1, a long but steady hike. Seal cove to the trailhead is a bit boring, you follow along an old road. Found out later if you ask, there is a shuttle you can pay for and skip the less scenic part of the hike.", "Overall it was an amazing hike. We did the loop backwards. Extremely rewarding. Amazing views. Loads of looks offs. \n\nAfter reading reviews and talking to folks we expected the hike to be far more challenging. \nWe would recommend this trail as a pre cursor to the Fundy foot path (friends we did the loop with us and said the footpath is far more challenging)", "Amazing trail with great views. It is a challenging hike but well worth the time and effort. Will be back to hike this again in the near future.", "Amazing trail!! We had great weather with no rain but high humidity. Stayed at Refugees Cove and Seal Cove both had swimming beaches which was great as it was mid-July when we were on the trail. Highly recommend!", "Beautiful trail beautiful scenery! Rated as hard and it is but well worth it. Did the trail in 3 days but would probably opt in doing it in 4 next time to enjoy it more. Refugee cove and Seal cove campsites were perfect! Would recommend for sure!", "Just hiked this for the first time with some friends who do it annually, we did the loop in 1 day ... which was not easy ... and didn\u2019t really give the opportunity to see the beauty at each lookout ... would recommend taking two days", "Absolutely the most beautiful place in Nova Scotia \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Simply Beautiful.", "great views.  plenty of long climbs but space between them to gather your steam back.\nCan be done in 3 days, 4 at a more moderate pace.", "This trail was challenging and exhilarating all at the same time. The first day we hiked 12 ish from visitors center to Refugee. There were 3 climbs and descents that were said to be 45 degrees steep and one km in length each way. It was a long, slow zigzag descent and an even slower ascent on the other side. With each down we knew there was an up coming. Honestly, I'd rather go up than down. \nDay 2 -we hiked 8ish km from Refugee to Big Bald Brooke. It was a spectacular day and absolutely beautiful scenery. There were some ups and downs, but not like day 1. The camp sites at big bald were lovely and we cooled off and cleaned up in the brooke right beside our camp site. \nDay 3- we planned on hiking to Seal Cove (7 km) but things changed and we decided to boogy out to Eatonville where were parked a car. Day 3 was rainy and foggy in the morning. However, even with the fog it was obvious that the views would be sellar on a clear day.\nTIPs: not for the faint of mind or heart.\nTIP 2: take electrolyte drink or tabs to replenish what was lost  in sweat\nTIP 3: purify all water!!!\nTIP 4: Be sure to hang food in a tree. 10' high, 5' out from the tree to avoid bears thinking you are the restaurant.\n \nAbove all... SMILE and enjoy", "One of the best backpacking trips we've done!", "Two and a half days of travel. This was a great excursion for my buddies and I. Challenging but amazing look offs.\n\n\"Task......Reward\" \n\n-Justin", "Beautiful Trail! The looped trail offers amazing backcountry camping without having to retrace your steps. New and amazing views every day. Did the full loop hike in 3 days and 2 nights. But for a relaxing pace and to have more 'down time' at your camping spots, I suggest 4 days and 3 nights. The best spots to stop for the night are Refugee Cove and Seal Cove. I have hiked the full trail in both July and August, both times water supplies were plentiful.", "Hiked this trail back in 2013 as soon as it was open with my husband. It was quite challenging with gear and took us 5 nights and 6 days. \r\nWe enjoyed the trip a lot. Plenty of chances to see the ocean and take pictures.", "hiked for 3 beautiful days at the end of September. Perfect time of year for this trail. keep your energy levels up:-)", "Just finished a five night, six day backpacking trip on this trail. It can be done in as little as three days. I took my time to see this beautiful coastal trail and met some amazing hikers along the trip. This is by far one of the best backpacking trails in Atlantic Canada. The trail is well marked and has plenty of streams and brooks so you never have to worry about drinking water. Water treatment is required ie: Tablets, water filtration pump. The tent sites are very well placed from the main trail and all have access to running streams to outdoor toilets. The trail can be challenging at times, but never extreme. The trails goes from Beautiful moss covered forests floors to amazing coastal views. This is a must see for anyone looking for minimally untouched wilderness.  Simply amazing!", "We had a great time just my husband and I.  We did the trail in 3 days, two nights.  It was quite the workout. Lots of ups and downs. The first day we hiked 20.8 Km.  It was the hardest day.  Climbing with a full heavy backpack and water. We stayed at little bald rock.  Couldn't make it to big bald rock, it was getting late and wanted to setup camp before dark.  The second day we hiked 16.09 Km .  It was challenging at times, but we were able to have a few longer stops which one included a swim in the cold bay.  It was great! We stayed at Seal Cove. Beautiful beach site where guided kayak tours stays overnight. Our third day hike was 22.2 Km. \nThe hardest day was day one. We say lots of wildlife and slept under the sounds of waves and squirrels chirping.  \nOur GPS and cell phone died throughout the trail, and off/on cloudy days prevented our solar charger to help us keep a full tracking of our journey. \nWe plan to do it again soon, but in 4 days,3 nights, so we can enjoy our evenings.  This trip was done more as a workout trip, and by 8pm we were dead tired in bed for the night.", "Beautiful !", "Great hike, nice trails, might be rough for beginners, lots of up and down hills some quite steep, views are breathtaking. Went there unprepared, if i go again will def bring tent and sleep 1-2 nights to see as much as possible.

Sunset is stunning if you can time your hike well.", "The trail itself was only challenging at the beginning- as in walking over the beach rocks. I used the private property hill on the way back because I found it so atrocious. \nThe trail is for the most part clearly marked with yellow indicators so you don\u2019t get lost. Whether it be on trees or rocks by the sea side just follow them. \nThe path is well maintained and an easy adventure walk. The scenery is absolutely stunning. The trail took me 7.5 KM and 2 hours as I dilly dallied a bit to take photos and footage on my camera. \nI didn\u2019t have any problems with ticks. \n", "Beautiful evening for the hike. 70 mins to complete.", "The rocks at the beginning were not too easy to negotiate but the rest of the trail was great!", "So, the first thing you need to know is that google maps sends you to the wrong place. No worries, the local residents have erected some signs to prevent you from going down the wrong road. Just keep going past the last road that google wants you to turn on and, instead, turn on Hirtle Beach Rd. There is a large parking lot there and it\u2019s fairly obvious you\u2019ve arrived.\n\nThe parking lot was packed but not full when we arrived in a Saturday at 11:00 AM. By the time we left at 1:30 PM, people were parking up and down the road\n\nThe only crappy part was walk the first/last part of walking across the rocks at the beginning/end along Hirtle beach. It\u2019s a rock painters dream, however. Do yourself a favour and take the uphill walk along the cliff to save yourself some walking on the rocks. It\u2019s private property but the owners only ask you to stay away if the horses are in the field. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get to the trail proper. It eventually is a loop. There is an earlier point that looks like it might be the loop but watch for the yellow markers. They lead you to the left. At the actual split, you can go either left or right. Left is a bit more challenging. \n\nTrail is easy to moderate. The kids and dogs can do it but not strollers. The Hirtle Beach portion is not for weak ankles or flip flops. \n\nTook is an hour and 5 minutes to reach Gaff Point in the middle. Nice inukshuks there and a few spots to stop for snack/break. Some really nice coastal views along the way. Trail is very mixed between wide forest path and walking along slate rocks. It is well marked with yellow paint. Trail conditions are great. ", "Great trail, pretty well marked and we found the secret beach. It starts on a beach and there\u2019s all kinds of terrain but ultimately it\u2019s a pretty easy, slightly moderate spot. Great views! ", "Amazing trail! Moderate difficulty. Worth the view!", "A must do. Great scenery of the ocean and interesting rock formations", "Terrain changed from sand to beach rock, to roots and granite rock.  West stable shoes.  Beautiful view.  There is a hidden beach but it was busy so not that secret and that was a cooler week day", "Very nice trail but very difficult to find due to incorrect directions on Google Maps. ", "Beauty!!", "beautiful trail with a great beach. bring your swimsuit for some water fun after this hike. the waves are bomb.", "A beautiful hike. Going at low tide is best so you can walk on the sandy beach. Otherwise you'll have to walk on the beach stones which is a bit awkward. There are some gorgeous views from the cliffs. ", "Love this coastal trail! Make sure to repel down to the sandy beach below. Spectacular views of the ocean and islands.  ", "2 days in a row! Spectacular hike", "Check my instagram for 12 min video. Awesome spot. Loved the walk and sights do not disappoint! Have proper footwear. No flipflops. @drscottmaclean #gaffpointtrail", "Great trail. It was a foggy day but still a great trail. Well maintained and easy to follow. Crossing a Stoney beach to start and end trail was the roughest ground. It was busy we met about 6 groups along the trail.", "Great and not to busy when I arrived at 10am. That changed when i returned to my car though.", "Beautiful trail. You have to walk on the beach for about 20 mins to get there which was nice as well. Few spots have downed trees on the trail but nothing too onerous to cross. ", "rocky along the water but fine once you hit the trail. honestly I've done a lot of hiking and this has been the best hike to date! Comparable to Taylor Head but I would say I enjoyed this more..  we even got to dip in the very cold and refreshing ocean afterward. highly recommend checking this one out!!!", "Loved this trail! A few trees down across the trail after storms this year. Not too hard to crawl around them though! ", "My definition of the perfect hike.  The trail is well marked and offers fantastic views throughout.  Loved the different terrain at various parts of the trail - from well-worn dirt paths, smooth rounded rocks, wooden planks, flat top stones, and more.  The trail is well maintained.", "Awesome trail. Hiked along the beach until we got to the trail head just to the right. Extremely well marked once you\u2019re on the trail. We kept to the left along the loop where we hiked through an area of sharp-ish rocks with a gorgeous ocean view. The point is a great place to stop and have a quick bite to eat. The way back was a bit wet with a couple of tree stumps to climb over but very well maintained. There were zero bugs but it was also only 14 degrees when we did the hike. Can\u2019t wait to go back!", "I love this trail. The only downfall at all is that the first and last is a very rocky 1 km each way that can be hard on the ankles but the rest is great and probably one of the best hikes on the south shore.", "Trail is pretty well kept. Absolutely gorgeous views but a lot of the time you\u2019re watching what your stepping on (on a lot of rocks). Very busy, thin trails. Great for a family walk.", "Has to be one of the best trials I\u2019ve explored so far. The trail was easily hiked and the views at every turn were breathtaking. Definitely recommend this trial. Will be back again.", "Great trail, beautiful sites", "One of my favourite hikes this year. We went a few days after Hurricane Dorian, so there were several downed trees across parts of the trail. That made some parts tricky, but still passable. The views are spectacular and worth climbing over some trees! We did it with our two dogs, they did find walking on the beach through the pebbles a bit difficult. ", "Wonderful views dry trail end of August, wear supportive comfortable shoes for the beach rocks and navigating tree roots, did the whole route in under 2 hrs taking time to stop for several photos along the point, if you choose to do only half the loop start on the left side for views if you don't mind some spots beach rock, someone painted yellow markers here n there for trail, can appreciate the logs in the marshy area that is needed during rains but personally didn't favour them on this dry day, the cliffs and mosses were beautiful and I would walk it again.", "Great hike, lot of nice views. The trail is well maintained, Recommend going out at low Tide.", "Trail was a great quick hike. From start to finish took me 1 hour 20 minutes with no stops in between. This trail is not strenuous but you definitely have to be sure footed on the beach rocks.", "Went on 03/08/2019. Started trail at noon, from Hirtle's Beach parking lot. The whole trail took us about 2 hours, with numerous stops and a swim at Hirtle's beach at the end. Walk down the beach for a couple kms to get to the actual trailhead. There's a few options to this: Walk on the sand, then up the rocks, or cut onto the farmer's private property and follow the foot trail up and back down the hill. We decided to walk along the beach. The rocks aren't that difficult, but witnessed some people struggling with their footing. An information board with a trail map indicates the started of the provincially maintained trail. You walk in abit and theres a three-pronged junction. Two of those have yellow spray paint indicating the trail to follow (That is used as the trail marker). This is the start of a loop. We took the right-most trail, hiking the trail clockwise. It is easy hiking through the forest, with numerous viewpoints of the ocean. The third path, the furthermost left trail, is an unmaintained foot path that'll lead you to the so-called \"secret beach\". This trail weaves along the cliff edge, and you may think that you're lost, but follow it to the end. Once arriving at the end, theres an overlook of the beach down below. Access it via the rope. Could be slippery if if was a wet day, so use your better judgement. Same can be said for swimming at that beach.  \r\nI would say the hike is a 3.5/5. Not that challenging, but on a nice day its a good afternoon hike. Not strenuous in the slightest. ", "I went at 8am on a Friday morning and there were 3 people at the beach and no one else on the trail. The volunteers do a great job of maintaining the trail though I felt a few yellow blazes could have been added. Gorgeous scenery though. Take tick spray and wear solid boots.", "What an awesome hike. This trail is worth every minute of driving to get to. Don\u2019t miss the unmarked trail to the hidden secret. ", "Was a trail with beautiful views by the cliffs and on the beach.  Watch out for ticks and make sure you bring bug repellant. Trail was a little muddy in some areas but there were logs put down to step on.  ", "Muddy sections need some upkeep but this is a favourite I have returned to for 14 years. I don\u2019t have a dog but if you do look out for sharp shale sections on coastline portion of the trail. ", "went with a group from the Hike NS Summit.  we started out in light rain which made the stretch across Hirtle Beach cobble a bit more tricky than the return when it was dry.  The spring rains and steady use of this trail made it quite muddy when you reach the wooded sections of the trail.  Having said that, my feet stayed dry and there were no big problems.  I believe this will be a great hike on a sunny day as the coastal sections are dramatic.  I did find the cobble a bit annoying and tricky to walk on.  Poles were handy getting around the mud puddles.  This trail is protected by the NS Nature Trust and the Nature Conservancy of Canada and the Kingsburg Trails Assoc?  ", "Did the hike today. the trail is very wet and muddy ( it rained for like a week) there is alot of roots, so watch your step. the views are still awesome \u2764", "love this trail!!! haven't found the secret beach yet, maybe next time.I am going back with in the next 2 weeks.", "great trail! I would rate it moderate for the uneven terrain  and some muddy bits ", "A great day with family.  We really enjoyed the trail as well as watching the giant waves coming to shore as we walked along the ocean.", "Definitely recommend this hike! It was suggested to us while we were visiting the area from Ontario in February. As many others said, the first stretch is along a very rocky beach but when you get to the trail it is well marked and well maintained. Beautiful views of the cliffs and water. We had some icy spots so I imagine other times of the year it could be quite muddy. We took about 2 hours from the parking lot and back with stops for pictures and views.", "Great trail with beautiful Oceanside views. The first km or so was crazy rocky, so be sure to have boots with good ankle support. Would definitely hike this trail again.", "A very rewarding hike with excellent ocean views. The first part of the trail crosses an eternity of lose beach rocks on the upper side of the beach. You should wear hiking shoes with ankle support - good place to roll an ankle. If you go in sneakers just be cautious. The trail itself is a loop with over half of it having ocean views. Good for on-leash dogs, however people like to break the rules which is rather annoying... parts of the wooded section of the trail can be extremely muddy but there are stones and boards to walk on to cross. There are also secrets to this trail. Find for yourself. \nThis is an area known for high levels of ticks so always practice good after-hike inspections of yourself and your pets. A good dose of the (pet-friendly) Atlantick spray before hiking this area would be recommended. Overall, this is a hike I go back and do every few years as it\u2019s interesting enough to do more than once.", "Great short hike with rewarding elevation changes, ocean views, a magical forest, and a few secret paths that you should explore. it is not EASY.. the trail requires rugged shoes, is very uneven in places, and the stones on the beach can be very hard to walk along, watch your step.", "Rocky beach, gorgeous cliff views, alternating terrain, inuksuks, mossy forests, a perfect day hike.", "Great hike, with amazing views for relatively little effort.  Cobble beach to start, check tides.  Follow loop clockwise for best impact.  Build an inuksuk, swim at a secluded beach.", "this trail begins at a lovely beach with good parking and bathrooms! the water is great for swimming and surfing! \n\nwalking close to the water on softer sand is very comfortable and pleasent! when the shore turns rocky, head to high ground where there is a beaten path. otherwise the round unstable rocks make for a difficult walk for sure!\nthe terrain has many changes which really make this hike fun and far from boring! great views, places to sit on ground to rest/lunch, explore off trail along shore, break shale to collect Fool's Gold, swimming holes. there is a place to jump about 30' down into a good pool! but it's also a good place to slip off the edge as you are running for the jump, and break your back on the rocks below! this is also a dangerous spot on the hike for kids who struggle with being aware of their surroundings!\nif you take your time to enjoy all this little gem has to offer, it is definitely an easy hike for all. any hike can be made difficult if you rush !! \n:)", "amazing views. the walk to the trail head along the beach on the Sea stones is not fun, but the elevated views from the point are gorgeous.", "Great trail. The first part along the beach is not the best way to start the trail, as it is quite long and not that beautiful... but lots of different paths and views are amazing ! Also not a lot of people so you get time to enjoy the trail on your own !", "Beautiful trail. Easily accessible for the whole family. The first portion (the beach) is not representative of all the nice things you can see along the way.", "Very nice trail with lots of different terrain and great views, it is quite annoying to get to the trail over the lose pebble beach but doesn\u2019t take too long.", "I did this trail 15 years ago with friends and everything I loved and hated about it then still applies.\n\nWear very supportive footware. This trail has many different types of terrain and having proper footware is a must.\n\nTry and arrive so that you can use the beach to walk on instead of the ankle rolling pebbles. Check the tide times.\n\nThe views are spectacular. The ocean puts on a show at every turn.\n\nJust make sure to leave lots of time, bring lots of water and proper food to sustain you and proper footware!", "Great day on the trail. Enjoyed with young kids and grandparents. Good for all. Beautiful view and a great place to picnic or enjoy a day at the beach at the end.", "Beautiful.", "One of my favorite!", "Lots of variety for a short hike,  should probably aim for around low tide for the beach bit.", "This hike starts out on the beach, then meets up with a very well maintained trail! It was foggy when I hiked it, but still a very nice hike.", "A Beautiful Coastal Trail with a mix of white sand beach, cobblestone shoreline, rocky cliff coastline, mossy meadows and evergreen forests.", "Beautiful spot, lots of beautiful look out points and not a difficult trail.", "Beautiful and well worth any trip. Park in the Hirtle Beach car park and run the coast along to Gaff Point. Worth any visit.

My favourite yet!", "great trail and plenty challenging. difficulty is accurate but if you are sure-footed and agile it's nothing to worry about. as an experienced and aggressive hiker it took 2 hours 10 mins.

Nice trail for fir adults..", "Great trail with many look offs. Definitely want to bring the bug spray for this one.", "A nice difficult trail. Lots of steep inclines, tree roots and rocks but incredible look-offs, a rock formation you can go through along the path, and beautiful lake views.

Of note, there are a few damp areas and really overgrown spots on the trail so bug spray is a must.", "great trail! definitely one of the harder ones i\u2019ve done out here. the trails were well marked and it wasn\u2019t too busy. the trails did fit a little narrow at some points so it was hard passing by people. overall great hike!", "Great trail! Lots of elevation change. DO NOT park on Bayer mill road. Had a visit with the local RCMP. No parking signs all over. Park on park road or the arena RCMP suggested.

This is coming from a moderately/average fit person. \n\nVery up hill hike but with stunning views. Went in a chilly and kind of rainy day without issue. Can\u2019t imagine it in the sunlight! ", "Amazing trail.. well marked which I \nlove especially when flying solo. \nviews were spectacular. I chose to head up at the 1.7 km on the rail trail heading in. Glad I did. It was easier going down the softer terrian at the other end by Jessies dinner than it would have been going down all the boulders at the first. \nheading back over the next few weeks to tackle the North and South Granite trails.\n", "Beautiful lookouts...we started this from the opposite end from what most do and challenged ourselves to alot of incline. Been lots of rain in the last 24 hours and this trail surprizingly drained well!  ...not alot of mud.  There's lots of rock and root...so it was slippery.

Snow was a bit slippery.", "lots of snow but fairly packed down path.\n", "Love this trail! The trail is challenging and the views are beautiful. Packed snow, some icy parts. Lots of ups and downs.

Will definitely do it again!", "Beautiful! Trail is mainly packed snow with a few slippery and icy patches but I did fine in boots without spikes. Trees keep you out of the wind which is perfect. Really fun trail", "Beautiful trail. Highly recommend", "Amazing trek.. well worth it", "Loved this trail.  It\u2019s well marked.  The lookout points were stunning.

It was 8 degrees out and nice and dry despite being overcast. Not a trail I would recommend if it was wet out, between the leaves and roots it would border on being dangerous. However, it was a nice dry trail. If you start on the Southern end, the hardest part of the entire trail is the first 1km. It\u2019s quite steep on the other end as well, but the southern end has a lot of rocks and roots to traverse. I looked forward to doing this trail for a while now. There are some amazing views from the top of the trail, but the highlight of my hike was Eunice Lake. There wasn\u2019t a breath of wind the entire hike so when I arrived at Eunice Lake, it looked like a mirror!  What a spectacular view. The trail head says to allow 5 hours and the maps provided on the trail say 4-5 hours. The main trail is 5.5km long and took me just under 2 hours hiking by myself. I ran into some others that said it took 2.5 hours.  All in all, a really nice hike. Take lots of water and some snacks for energy. ", "Great condition, the parking on Bayers Mill is a good idea, take out a couple km of rail trail.", "This is the second year in a row doing this hike! It's not an easy one, but not too difficult either, lots of rock climbing so wear proper footwear, a few look offs which had really nice views! Trail is marked the whole way, but there was one part where  the trees over gown down by the lake, where we missed the marker, and didn't realize we did a circle, so took us probably 15 mins longer this time, you have to go down right to the lake and go to the right! Took us just under 5 hours to complete, including a a stop for lunch and a few other stops .\n", "It was a bit difficult for my second hike but felt pretty good that I completed the trail.", "Awesome but difficult \n", "Could be cut back in some spots but great hike", "Trail is a bit over grown in some sections.

I've jogged it in an hour so take the 4-5 hour rating with a grain of salt if you're able bodied and not stopping for breaks. ", "Really great trail! the woods were beautiful and I saw a very friendly deer. I went a day after it rained so there were mosquitoes but as long as I kept at a steady pace they didnt bother me (I wasn't wearing bug spray). Also didnt find any ticks on me or my dog so that's a plus. The signage was very good, lots of little yellow reminders that you're on the right trail. The rocks were a bit slippery at some parts so definitely make sure you're wearing hiking shoes. Also, park at the end of Bayer Mill road, otherwise you're going to be walking on flat boring trail for 2km.", "Great trial if you're looking for more of a challenge due to the rocky terrain. Elevation gain is steady with some steep sections but beautiful payoff at the top. The sign says 4 to 5 hours at 45km per hour but it only took me 3 hours going at a moderate pace. After you get to the lookout point you can choose to do a small look that goes by Admiral Lake or you can just turn back the way you've come because the trail is really just an out and back with a loop attached and the view at Admiral Lake was not totally worth it. ", "We did this hike for Canada Day, and it was hot! Lots of mozzies and flies out, and humid. The terrain is difficult with lots of rocks and roots that were slippery. Moderate elevation. Really great look outs and views! My favorite part was squeezing through a boulder structure. Great hike, but maybe not for 25+ days", "Did this trail on Saturday June 20th and would of loved it if it wasn't for the heat. This is a difficult trail with amazing views and look off points. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a challenge. I brought alot of water and would recommend others do the same. ", "Did this trail yesterday, and it was quite difficult! Well marked trail full of up and downs. Lots of cool look offs, but there was no stopping because the bugs were so bad! ", "Great trail - I would rate it as moderate to difficult as there are some steep hills, slippery spots and a little climbing required. Took about 3 hours from start to end. Very well marked and well maintained. Will definitely be returning to try the other hikes within the system. ", "What a great loop! Definitely accurately rated as difficult with steep inclines and declines, lots of large rock on the trail. An excellent challenge. Perfect evening loop to see the sun setting. Would recommend starting by 5. At a decent pace it is easily done in under 3 hours. Very little mud and only encountered one other person on the loop trail. Definitely going to go back!  A must do, in the fall, as the views will be amazing.", "Well marked and a very scenic walk through the forest with several look-off points. Lots of inclining trail which was a great challenge. Light traffic on a weekday midday - we encountered 4 other groups and a few others along the main path leading to the trail loops. Will hope to get out again in Fall to experience the views.", "awesome trail, but pretty challenging! dogs loved it and we didn\u2019t run into too many other people.  will be back for sure!", "Great trail for a Thursday afternoon hike.  The rail trail at the beginning was very busy, however we quickly lost the crowds once getting on the trail.  When walking down the rail trail from the parking lot, the entrance to the Admiral Lake Loop is an unmarked off shoot into the woods with red and yellow markers nailed to the trees (Admiral Lake Loop is the yellow markers).  We accidentally missed the entrance and ended up doing the loop backwards.\r\n\r\nMake sure you take the ~20m side trail labeled 'Janet's Diner' - great spot for lunch!\r\n\r\nIt took our group of 2 + dog (on leash) approximately 3 hours to complete the loop including the 5km of rail trail with a half hour lunch in the middle.  Icy sections on a lot of the ascents and descents, but plenty of snow and rock exposed enough to avoid needing to use microspikes.", "This was an awesome hike! Did it in the middle of the winter so it was quite icy. Lots of steep hills but was rewarded with great views. I did the admiral lake loop, and the skull rock lookoff.  Was about 11 km and took me and my golden retriever just over 2 hours to complete although we were moving quick and only stopped to look at the views. The signage for admiral lake loop recommends 4-5 hours for the trail which I thought was a bit much ", "challanging trail, lots of steep climbing,  beautiful look offs make all the climbing well worth it. Well marked trail, a little muddy in spots.", "Started too late to do entire loop. Made it to Harbour View, then headed back.", "Great trail, nice views on some of the smaller trails to look-offs. \r\nWas a fair bit of people using it, lots of up and down, but nothing too challenging if you are in good shape. \r\nWe did the loop itself in 2.5 hours with just one stop on a brisk pace", "Started from the Bayers Mill Rd entrance to avoid the large trailhead. Hiked this with my 3 month old strapped to me, my frenchie and my friend and her 2 pups. Kept a moderately fast pace. I consider myself to be in great shape but some of the up hill parts will have your heartrate jacked and breathing heavy! Definitely will be doing this one again. Recommend it if you want a good workout. ", "Amazing trail, had such a nice hike. Perfect in this season to see all of the colours. Definitely in the intermediate/advanced category, not a hike for unfit people. We powered through the entire thing and was well worth it. So many stops along the way for stunning scenery and overlooking the forests and lakes. ", "Loved it!  After a heavy rain overnight the trail was magical.  Rich moss, lichen and. ferns in full force.  Blueberry treats along the way, great overlooks.  Not for the less than fit hiker.  Lots of rocks and roots and long sections of dense bushes to get through.  ", "Love this hike. Steep inclines and declines. Lots of rock climbing. Stunning views. Over grown sections but still very easy to follow the trail. The cave is awesome and very unique. Took us 2.5 hours but sign estimates 45min a km. ", "It was a cool trail but hard on the knees.", "A little bit hard, but the view is definitely worth it.", "Excellent afternoon trail that gives too a little taste of everything. I\u2019ve only ever walked flyers trail and salt marsh every other day so this was the first trail that I pictured as a \u201chiking trail\u201d. The sign says 4-5 hours but I hiked it in 90 mins. I\u2019ll definitely bring my wife and daughter out to experience this one. The trail seems well kept, marked with yellow indications every few meters and that makes it nearly impossible to step off the trail and get lost. ", "It\u2019s amazing trail. I would recommend it as it is really moderate compared to most of the moderate trails in Nova Scotia. Most of the time you walk into forest but several amazing views make the trail really beautiful.\nBring bug spray.", "Very nice trail. Bring bug spray tho. \n\nWould recommend. :)", "In the past I\u2019ve completed this trail but the other day two of us tried to do it and a fallen tree caused us to go around and we weren\u2019t able to find the trail again and we\u2019re forced to turn around. Would love it if someone could either add more trail markers or make the path more obvious so people don\u2019t get lost. Also, there\u2019s private property which is easy to accidentally venture into. Trail was hard to find", "Beautiful hikes with lots of great surprises along the way!", "Great hike with my dog. Beautiful elevation and views with lakeside spots as well. One of my new favorites around the city!", "Such a good little hike that\u2019s all up hill to the look off aka skull rock and then a nice way back all the way down!", "We went at a steady pace and completed the loop in 3 hours. It would be easy to spend a lot longer at all the look offs. Great views.", "Super, lots of views and a good workout with ups and downs. Come prepared with boots, food and water. Did it on 7 October.", "The sign isn't joking when it says to budget 45min/km. Worth every minute, absolutely stunning views.", "Great spot! Trail is clearly marked and easy to follow. Took about 3 hours to complete and says it's only 5.5 km", "Fantastic! Strenuous climb worth it for the spectacular views. The trails are well signed and marked clearly with flags.", "great hike, love the terrain :)", "lovely trail, challenging in places with spectacular views.  still snow in the forests in the vallies so be prepared for that.  The \"Cave\" pass through was a pleasant surprise.", "Not long,  but not an easy hike, along a rock-strewn path (the Admiral Lake loop), up and down a ridge.  The path to and from the loop is wide,  flat and gravelled; pleasant enough if you have children or aren't in the best of shape.", "Great hike, not far from the city. Once on the trail it's well marked. However there comes a point in the beginning with a fork in the road that isn't well marked.", "Rail Trail is quite level and well defined. The Admiral's Loop is also relatively easy to follow, at least the trail with the yellow markers. The views are spectacular and well worth the effort to get there. It is however a rigorous hike not meant for anyone not in decent shape. Take plenty of water and pictures. Took approximately 5.5 hours including walk from parking lot and back.", "The Admiral Lake Loop was a great hike, it's very rough natural terrain, every vista was beautiful. Took us about  4 hours to complete it, I cannot wait to go again.", "This trail is amazing I hike it once every year since I was just a kid there is a loop that takes you the hole day to complete and there is another one that it for overnight campers love love love this trail and can't get enough of it", "great trail, with beautiful look offs. there is a main path that connects 3 different loop trails. the main path is great for biking and has spots to lock you bike up in front of the trails. as someone said before this trail is not for beginners or kids.", "Really nice trail with great views.

", "If you\u2019re bushwhacking, you\u2019ve missed the trail and, since some of this is protected, you should turn back and find the trail. \n\nBeautiful coastal views, funky ww2 bunkers, not marked but easy to follow trail so long as you get the actual trailhead. \n\nBE RESPECTFUL OF PRIVATE PROPERTY. This little community has dealt with a lot of BS from hikers trespassing and, if we all want to be allowed on the trail at all, we all must be respectful. ", "I\u2019m actually super disappointed, and I was really looking forward to this hike for quite some time. The end views are incredible, but the hike in is horrendous. \n\nAs others have mentioned, Google maps marks the trailhead at Gannet Lane which is on private property. So the All Trails trailhead is where we started (which is also a challenge to find as there is no signage). I only had a \u201ctrail\u201d for about 1km in, the rest is marsh and bushes. I followed the All Trails map as there are 0 signs on the hike, and it was knee deep swamp for more than half of the hike today. Maybe I went off the actual trail somehow? If that\u2019s the case then the All Trails map is grossly wrong. Or maybe we\u2019ve just had a ton of rain lately. \n\nWhat should have been a 2 hour hike took about 3 1/2 with very limited time on the rocks as we knew we had a big journey back to the car. ", "Excellent condition, amazing views. A classic walk! Plus, we got the news that Biden won while on our walk. Big\ufffc celebration!!!!", "It\u2019s a beautiful coastal trail with old historic bunkers and breathtaking views of the ocean! Some bushwhacking, many wet spots, and some parts of the trail are along the cliffs so be prepared. Such an inspiring hike. Terry Sheppard(a review just below mine) gave the best directions for finding the trail head.", "beautiful views, fun trail, lots to see", "Beautiful trail. Beautiful scenery along the ocean", "This is probably one of the best coastal trails we have in NS, and that is saying something. The trail is not maintained but easy to follow. Once you get to the coast, you just follow along it until you reach the abandoned bunker. \n\nThe real challenge is finding the trail entrance. The app will take you to a trail head no one uses. Everyone goes in off Gannet Lane although it is a private road. \n\nYou go along Ketch Harbour Rd. to Chebucto Head Rd. And then turn on Duncan\u2019s Cove Road. If it is a nice day on the weekend, there will likely be line of cars parked along the side of the road. There is a house at the end with a \u201cprivate property\u201d sign up. Gannet Lane is a dirt road off to the right. There is another house at the end of that lane with a \u201cprivate property\u201d sign up. Here is where it is tricky to find the trail head. It is right by a power pole. I\u2019ve posted a picture. There are a couple little trails that all merge together eventually. \n\nThere is very little bushwhacking on the trail. You are out in the open for the vast majority of the hike, so sun screen and hats in the summer. You are right along the coast so it is windy. \n\nThe hike ends at an old army bunker. Well, there is a long rock wall about 5 - 10 minutes away that you can see from the bunker. There is a huge private home behind the rock wall. \n\nThis is definitely a moderate hike with lots of ups and down. We did see some dogs and children along the way. They can do it with some help. There are a number of spots that you are right by the cliff so keep a careful eye. \n\nTook us 1 hour and 22 minutes on the way in, stopping for pictures and enjoying the scenery. 1 hour and 4 minutes on the way out without many stops. It\u2019s about 6 kilometres. \n\n", "Such a beautiful area. The sea breeze, the sounds of the waves, just so nice. \n\nit's a pretty easy hike", "Love this trail. Have done many times to enjoy the view.", "Great hike! Not very strenuous and amazing views! WW2 bunkers were very neat!", "The trail itself is clear but prone to muddiness after bad weather. There are various routes you can take (either scrambling over rocks closer to the shore or heading through trodden paths in the trees and bushes). \n\nIf you start on Gannet Lane then there is quite a steep climb down at the start of the trail. The start of the trail is clearly marked by a wooden sign on a power line just before the private house. \n\nThe views are beautiful in all weather. Due to the up-and-down over the rocks, I would agree that this trail is moderate and you should come prepared with sturdy footwear and water. \n\nThis trail is not maintained. ", "Grown over and neglected. Very wet after weeks of no rain. Did not even bother to complete the trail it was so sub par to other trails around.", "A little over grown  hard to find trails", "So much mud! ", "Amazing view. It's a little mucky at the start and once you're through to the water you can avoid most wet spots by using the rocks.  It can occasionally get slippery but we had a great time. My kids loved the climb. ", "One of my favourites! Can be wet in the spring so bring good boots. ", "Super nice. Bring pants and extra socks for swampy areas.", "Today was my first time at this trail and I absolutely loved it. very clean and most of the dogs I have seen were on leashes.  \nin some areas around the trail it was very muddy, so make sure you wear proper shoes for your hike :)", "Beautiful view, I would definitely go again. It was kind of confusing to find at first.", "We parked at the turnaround near Duncan's Cove and Chebucto Head Roads and walked back to the trailhead on the oceanside marked by yellow nature preserve signs. Mid-March we ran into flooded sections every 5 min and only made it 2km in. On the way home we saw lots of cars parked at the lighthouse turnoff and Duncan's Cove Rd at Gannet Ln, mind the no parking signs, it would must be an easy walk from there to the oceanside. Will try that next time!", "Although it is hard to find and I did a different trail since I could not find the actual trail through all the private property signs I did find it by mistake. The easiest way to get to it is to park by the gate to the lighthouse and walk up the road to the lighthouse. On your right you will see one of the old Bunkers, follow the trail down to them and it continues around. I parked at a small turning spot where the Duncan's cove road and the Chebucto Head Heads intersect. There is a trail there that is about 2km of wooded/marsh trail and then becomes coastal taking you to the Lighthouse where you can continue to the Duncan's Cove trail and then just take the road back to your vehicle", "Great views, neat old buildings.  Many different ways to go as the trail is not marked so I went 2 different ways.  Awesome hike!", "Beautiful views of the coastal barrens. Found the trails further from the coast quite muddy. Need good shoes for navigating the rock near shore. I would definitely go back again.", "Beautiful! Took about 3 hours spent total, 2 there because we were exploring and enjoying the view and 1 hour back because we were hungry. \nBring water and snacks! Easy walking on the trail and easy enough to follow but better to stay in the main trail. Wear good shoes for hiking and bring layers since the wind can make it cold. Worth the trip!\nThe first bay is Duncan\u2019s cove and then there is duck reef and Eastern Cove which is the biggest, the end is Gill\u2019s Cove where you can see the lighthouse and get some shield from the wind behind the bunker.", "Beautiful views.  Can be very busy", "Amazing view, nice hike. The old forts are neat. Watch your step.", "Really beautiful hike along the water. Rocky terrain, just a couple of muddy spots. Saw a large group of seals on Duncan Reef. Trail is not marked, but quite easy to follow. Well populated hiking route. ", "ocean view hike, absolutely beautiful on a sunny day ", "Beautiful trail with amazing ocean views the entire hike. Got to pass 2 sea caves (could hear them only, not really see them) comparable to the Thunder Hole in Maine. No parts of the trail were muddy and was easy to find the way to the look out station as you could see it a few km ahead in the distance. This a trail we decided to leave our dog home for and I\u2019m glad we did. My opinion: this trail is not suitable for dogs - extremely sharp rocks/rough terrain, thorn bushes, and steep drop offs. An accident could easily occur, however people seem to think this is an off-leash free for all. Could be a bad situation if an on or off leash dog approached another as the trail is extremely narrow in places, often on the edge of a drop off.\n\nAside from that this is the most beautiful and enjoyable hike we\u2019ve done in NS to date. There was beautiful scenery at all times. My opinion: this is a much better and more diverse trail than Cape Split. The hike took us under 3 hours to complete (including two 10-min breaks, and a 25-min break for lunch at the end). \n\nNote: parts of the trail require a bit of maneuvering/slight rock climbing. ", "This trail is beautiful. Can be very tricky to follow as the trail is mainly human made but definitely my favourite in Nova Scotia!! \n", "Forced to turn back halfway through (before the reportedly spectacular ocean views) as the trail disappeared into a bog interspersed with pools. Prior to that there were multiple boggy/muddy sections that made for very slow going. Overall, a miserable aborted hike. If you care about preserving the environment do not attempt this trail for the foreseeable future.", "Depending on how you go about it (I\u2019ve done a couple different routes now) - parts can be a bit overgrown and you can lose track of the path when really wet (I most recently went in spring after a LOT of rain)... so also be prepared for your feet to get wet if you aren\u2019t wearing waterproof hikers. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing this in sandals or flip flops. Great visits overlooking the Atlantic out at the mouth of the harbour.", "All swamp and bogey ", "*THIS IS A NATURE RESERVE - NOT A PARK*\r\nThe trail is NOT managed. There are no facilities and no signage.\r\nIt is protected under Nova Scotia\u2019s Special Places Protection Act.\r\nThis means that the habitats and species are vulnerable to disturbance and damage; recreation is restricted. \r\nDogs must be kept on leash and stay on trail at all times.  \r\nAll fires, camping, hunting, trapping, motorized AND non-motorized vehicle access are prohibited (that means no ATVs, motorcycles, or mountain bikes, or strollers).\r\nHikers should stay on the main trail and follow LEAVE NO TRACE principles.\r\nAnd beware of Black-legged ticks!", "A gorgeous coastline hike with seals and tides.", "Stunning ocean and tide views on a partly cloudy and breezy Sunday. For a NW wind, waves and tides were still eye-catching and loud. Highly recommend for semi-agile people and dogs, the further you go the more tougher the terrain. Overall, a great active hike along a gorgeous coast line.", "I enjoyed this trail, was absolutely beautiful. A little tricky is places due to rough terrain and mud but that\u2019s a part of hiking and part of the adventure. I\u2019ve never done this hike before so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always quite wet or if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s spring and wet anyway but I\u2019d recommend extra socks and shoes for after. Also, if you\u2019re someone you needs to use washroom regularly it\u2019s not a great spot. No outhouses (which is noted) but also no trees to hind behind. Lol", "I did the trail on a foggy day. Hands down one of the best hikes I have done in Nova Scotia. The entire trail hugs the rugged coastline making for incredible views. Will definitely do it again", "great hike, and amazing views. the trail was very boggy and muddy. But it's a time of year issue I'm guessing.", "Great walk out to army shack and back . January 27 2019 plus 4!", "Went in mid- November. Trail still good but a bit muddy. Definitely need sturdy boots- lots of rocks and uneven terrain. Coastline views are spectacular. Well worth it.", "A gorgeous hike right on the ocean - highly recommended!", "Very busy trail and easy to walk past the trailhead. Aside from that this is an easy trail for anyone to walk and the views are absolutely amazing. We saw seals wading in the surf the day we were there. There's lots to explore here so make sure you have a lot of time!", "definitely my favorite coastal trail with lots of elements, you will never get bored aha!", "This is one of our favorite hikes.Views are amazing and variety of terrain just right", "Easy, heavily used trail with great views of the rugged coastline.  We were lucky enough to see 10 to 12 seals playing in the surf breaking around several rocky islands just offshore.  Private property so be respectful.  It's also a nature preserve so minimize your impact!", "My favourite hike. Beautiful views and lots of opportunity for adventure.", "Great hike! Beautiful views all the way, gorgeous fauna and lots of places to stop and let the dogs have some water. Loved the variation of trail from open flat rocks to short steep stints to deep forest and windy trails through lush plant life. Our dogs had no problem with this hike, just took it slow to allow for breaks and water. 3 hrs round trip with our breaks.", "Great views along the entire trail. Some boggy areas, but managed not to ruin my boots. Some steep climbs and ascents. Be sure to wear appropriate footwear. Entrance to trail can be confusing. Weathered  sign says \u2018Private Property\u2019 and there is a low gate to hop over.", "Great views all along the trail. Just about 20-30 mins from Halifax. The first bit in the north part of the trail goes through some private property where no vehicles are allowed, but it looks like many people go through it to get onto the trail anyways", "We saw sea lions just off the shore. Trail is quite muddy in parts!", "Very scenic.", "Really enjoyed this trail. Not overly challenging and beautiful views of Nova Scotia\u2019s rugged coastline. Will definitely be back to do this hike over, and over again.", "Amazing trail, with a wide verity of scenery it has something for everybody, and depending on how brave you are, many small rock beaches to explore", "Beautiful hike with stunning views!!! Terrain can be a bit muddy/soggy so make sure to have good footwear!", "Absolutely beautiful hike.  You will see waves crashing on the shore, rolling hills, woods, cliffs and even bunkers that were built for WWII.  The scenery is breath-taking.  Use a little caution and be sure to wear proper hiking shoes as there are a few areas of difficult terrain.", "This was a spectacular hike! The view!", "Once you get to the abandoned ww2 observation station, you must turn around. There is a 1000 foot long boulder wall beyond, with a number of No Trespass signs. If you stray, you will be on  private property and damaging vulnerable flora and interfering with wild life that the owners are feeding and encouraging. Please respect the flora and fauna and turn back to Duncan's Cove.

I have hiked this trail two other times, both times completing it counter-clockwise, and now that I\u2019ve done it clockwise, I can\u2019t imagine why we ever did it the other way! \nThe way up, there are a few steepish hills, but nothing too challenging for someone with average to good cardio fitness (hills aren\u2019t my forte!). Also on the way up, you will encounter SO much moose scat and a few spots of bear scat. I actually did this hike alone this time, and I admit, I was a little nervous. There are many berry patches and open bushy areas on the ascent, that I imagine would be pure heaven for bears. But I didn\u2019t see any think more animated than a squirrel with a leaf in his mouth, peering at me in fascination, from behind a tree trunk. It could be I was the only person he saw, as there was NO ONE else on the trail with me the entire time. It was eerily quiet- other than my loud singing and yogi bear calls, to ward off furry company.\nThe view was uninspiring, ONLY because it was foggy - not the trail\u2019s fault - my bad for picking a foggy day. Other times that I have done this trail, the views are out of this world - so I do recommend going on a cool, clear day, if you are looking for the best vistas. \nThe entire way down, you will feel as if you are stepping through a rain forest but without the humidity, and the stream at your side is so zen-like. Something out of a movie, truly. It looks so different than the trail on the way up - much greener and more lush - like completely different trails that have been merged. A few bridge planks are a bit slippery, so watch your footing, and there\u2019s only one muddy area to traverse. So very easy in that sense.\nGreat hike, overall! But I highly recommend having a hiking buddy for this one, just for safety sake. Also cell phone service is there almost all the time, but there are a few quick spots where you\u2019ll have no service. Walk a few steps and it will return. Just be aware. \n\n", "Absolutely beautiful - including all the lookouts, my Fitbit actually calculated around 11 kms; however, the entire hike only took us about 2.5 hours. Very few breaks - just to catch our breath and keep going! I second the reviews that say to do this in clockwise motion, as you\u2019ll appreciate the shade of the latter half. :) ", "We saw so many moose droppings we thought we might actually see a moose! Great hike. We went clockwise and would recommend doing it that way. It was hot and buggy going up, though coastal views were beautiful. Coming down along the water was so nice and cool.

It took about 3.5 hours to complete with all look offs and breaks included.", "Hiked 06/2020. I'd say path conditions were roughly the same as the Franey trail in terms of uphill walking difficulty and the changes from rocky-grass-gravel. Lookouts are gorgeous but some of the signs were down so we just went down the little paths", "Hiked 11/4/19. Great trail. It provides a variety of terrain and views: birch forests, areas of dense fir trees, tranquil mossy rock stream, followed by wind battered barren trees and grass trail with great overlooks of the gulf, We hiked counterclockwise late in the day, which created wonderful light for the overlook portion. We finished in just over 2 hours, hiking at a rapid pace to beat the dark. We saw woodpeckers and chipmunks, not a single other person at this late point in the season. ", "One of the better trails in the National Park area of Cape Breton for sure. The west side of the loop is where you\u2019ll see great views of the Cheticamp area and a number of scenic lookouts, while the east side takes you along a gentle brook in a more wooded setting. Pick which order you think you\u2019d like to see it in, or you can do an out and back of the west side if all you want is views. I went with the woods first (counterclockwise) and it seemed like the way up the hill may have been a bit less steep that way, although either way is a gradual climb and isn\u2019t anything super strenuous, and either way the views are worth it.", "Challenging incline and superb views. We saw 2 moose at the very top - very very worth it. On the way down we followed the river back to the carpark. One of our favourite hikes in Cape Breton. ", "We loved this hike, we went clockwise although it seemed most people went counter, we enjoyed it very much. The look offs were amazing and the trail that follows the river was challenging and enjoyable. ", "Very nice hike and quite a good workout. Lots of different sceneries, likes many different hikes all bundled into one.", "Skill level: Intro/Beginner\nDifficulty: 7.6/10\nDone in Early July\nEnjoyed it thoroughly. We did the hike by going up the mountain (so you get peeks of the glorious view as you climb upwards) and then finished going by the brook. We preferred it that was as it was relaxing coming down. The day we went winds were at least 80km/hr so be weary of that. It was a stunning hike and one of our favs at Cabot Trail", "The trail is beautiful!

You can get a kids activity guide (similar to the US Jr. Ranger program) at the visitor center.", "Great trail. Saw a moose. No bears. Diverse views and foliage!", "This is just an amazing hike! The trail is very pretty and the views are breathtaking! And its not a really hard trail! I\u2019ve worked more for less!", "Have done this twice and loved it. Not for the inexperienced. Great views at the top, a lovely stream on one side, and nice scenery all along the way. Keep kids and dogs close as some parts are very narrow with a steep and dangerous drop off.", "This was a beautiful hike with stunning views. All uphill if you keep to the left. If you go right, it\u2019s easier going but you will punish your knees on the decent. If you\u2019re an occasional hiker this trail isn\u2019t for you. \nAgain, loved every step. \nNote. Trail ended up at 10.9km all said and done. \nLoved it!", "A great trail!  We started up on the western trail, which is a little steeper.  But completely doable.  Of course we saw tons of other hikers, but we had a number of nice chats when we stopped to rest, usually at the scenic overlooks.  We were able to see all the destruction caused by the moose, as well as the very different areas of the forrest.  We very much enjoyed the views of the coast, and the stroll along the creek.", "Did the full loop but AllTrails did not record the path accurately.  Health app recorded 8.7km for this one.", "Take a left when u ascend. This section of the trail is gravel and dirt with benches along the way and a number of excellent look out points. The last two look outs have the best view of Ch\u00e9ticamp village and the Island. U can choose to go back down the same way or do the loop. If u do the loop, be mindful the conditions of the interior trail is rocky and many sections also muddy because it runs along a brook. U will see a number of small waterfalls. We saw a large black bear on our way up. He was on the trail and we observed him from a distance and waited for him to move out before continued.", "Gorgeous!

Overall a great hike.", "Beautiful trail however be prepared if you do the entire loop that is is muddy and a bit tricky to find the trail when going from coastline into the wooded trail. The second part (when going clockwise) was the muddiest.

The small trails would be tight with all the shrubs. Beautiful views !!!", "A bit of a challenging hike. Took us longer than expected. Some beautiful views along the way and the sound of the waves was soothing. Given the time of year with a lot of snow having melted, it was quite muddy in some spots. Decent hiking boots are important. The app helped keep us on track. Not well marked in some places. Blue dots painted on many rocks along first half of trail (we went counter clockwise). If you\u2019re up for a good (but not easy!) hike and have hours to kill, this is a good one! Note: we parked close to the locked gate, along the road where there are obvious \u201cno parking\u201d signs and we did get a ticket. It\u2019s unfortunate that so many trail parking lots are closed off at this time of year. ", "Beautiful trail! We loved it. However there are a few sections where we had to figure out where the trail was. We went on February 5 and it was very muddy as we had a lot of rain and a few warm days.

We did the hike clockwise. Very clearly marked until about 7-8k along. At that point, we could not see how to continue and there were no markers. It was very wet so I guess the trail was covered with water? We backtracked and started to head back the way we came. We ended up doing the trail that is up from the water and it is WET right now.  I definitely recommend this hike but would not do the in-land trail.  Keep ocean side. ", "I did the trail counter-clockwise Nov 22, 2020. It was a very enjoyable experience at a few degrees above freezing. Quite different temperatures whether in the trees or out on the rocks in the wind. Some very rugged rock hopping and some muddy and boggy areas also. Very enjoyable overall.", "Beautiful nearly every step of the way. A little tricky when water is on the trail, but nothing strenuous.", "Same as everyone else has said about conditions!! Amazing views throughout definitely one I will do again", "Good hike! Will echo a couple of the comments below with the gorgeous views, especially on the east side. The west side of the trail is not as well marked and I did find myself off it a couple of times. Because it\u2019s along the coast it was easy to get back on. Muddy areas so boots are best, and pants for sure, especially for the last stretch across back to the parking lot! Also the gate is now closed for the season so you need to park close to the road and walk in and through the parking lot to access the trail. ", "Good trail, the west slide of the loop was very muddy and over grown and not well marked. Very beautiful though and the beach is a bonus!!! ", "Easy hike, gorgeous ocean views. Took me 3 hours including a long lunch stop. Went at 8:30 on a Saturday morning and had the trail to myself. Only one bit of the path was a little washed out but I found the trail again without too much trouble.", "Nice easy run. Enjoy doing this one when I don\u2019t feel like a long run or after I\u2019ve done the Bluff a couple of days in a row.", "Beautiful hike! So many spots where it just opens up and the views are amazing. \n\nOvergrown in a lot of spots. Thank god I was wearing pants or my legs would be pretty torn up. App was needed to navigate some of the trails as they are overgrown and there are some places that look like trail that are not. \n\nBarely saw any other people. Very cool to stand on the rocks and hear the water and then keep walking to the utter silence of the woods. Well worth the overgrown parts! ", "Great trail!  Some amazing views!  Definitely needed the app for navigation!", "Wet in the usual spots after the rain.", "Great easy run along the coast. Wet in some spots near the end. But not major.", "I hiked counter clockwise, as a lot of people suggested below. Really enjoyed the first half of the hike, mixture of woods and coastal. Saw very few people on a Friday afternoon, only big crowds once I reached the beach. Trail is overgrown, wet and soggy at some places. ", "Whoa! I had no idea this great adventure was only mere steps past the nude beach! \n\nWalked this trail last month and loved it! Beautiful coastal views similar to Taylor Head and Pollys Cove. I found the last half of the trail to be a bit sketchy (I went clockwise) because it\u2019s a bit grown in and not well marked but it was still fun. \n\nNear the last bit in the open fields I ran into a hawk mama who was not very excited about me being there. She chased and swooped for a little bit- I made sure to face her direction, yell, and put my backpack above my head and it was fine. Thinking she must of had some fresh lil babies! \n\nAlso on the last half my gps kept telling me I was in Lunenburg? If this happens don\u2019t worry, you haven\u2019t mysteriously been transported to Lunenburg... not that I thought that or anything... \n\n\nAlso! I encourage you to look up the Indigenous histories and presents of the land you\u2019re hiking on. Think about what it means as settlers to use this unceded Mi\u2019kmaq land for pleasure.", "A great trail. Recommend going anti clockwise so that you go through the ever so slightly overgrown and humid section first, and cool off with the sea breeze and views along the second half. \n\nWell but subtly marked along the length of the trail. The map on here is reliable too.\n\nSome hopping between rocks is necessary, and a few patches will be quite muddy outside of summer. ", "Great trail.  Beautiful views of the ocean, large open fields.   Did this mid summer and still muddy spots but manageable.  ", "Great trail! Single track not too technical for trail running. But you need to pay attention to the trail ... ground trail is easy to follow but quite overgrown with ferns and such at eye level.", "Unreal trail and views. Probably one of the best coastal trails in HRM. Follow the blue marks on the ground to stay on the trail. Some overgrown and muddy spots. ", "Started going cross country from beach and hiking counterclockwise. That was a good decision. Some overgrown areas. Wear long pants if hiking the complete loop. Had some technical difficulty with recording but it\u2019s about 10k in total. Still a bit muddy in spots. Is the seal rock just nature\u2019s art?! Amazing! Not many bugs at all and it was a humid drizzly day. A real gem of a trail in NS.", "Hiked the East Pennant Point trail today. (July 19) 10.5km, 20300 steps in 4 hours. We started at the green dot at the top and took screen shot when 1/2 way (blue dot). Great trail, wet in places, watch the footing and roots, few deer flies other then that no bugs, so this is a good time of year to walk it. Great views. Places to sit and enjoy the views. I would suggest walking the top barren woods across to the bay part first because it may be a hot run and very tiring at the end. \nExpect some nudity in place to in passerby\u2019s as you getting closer to the third beach. ", "The hike was pretty awesome in the beginning. Got nice views and Fresh ocean breeze. But half of the trail is not well maintained and got really narrow overgrown paths. Remember to take mosquito repellent cream and water", "Completed this hike today starting from the beach end to the point and up the far side of the point and through the woods/barrens back to the parking lot.\n\nThe trail past the beaches and to the point is fairly well marked but it is so open that it is impossible to get lost. Beautiful scenic ocean views along the way. It is fairly busy as the trail to this point is not difficult so it is an attraction for those who are not hardcore hikers. Most of them however, hike to the point and turn around and return the way they came.\n\nContinuing past the point the crowd thins out immensely. About half of the far side is similar to the hike to the point. The trail is not marked as well but it is so open that you cannot get lost. There are several spots where high tide could create an issue with a dry passage. \n\nThe second half of the far side winds into the woods along the shore peaking out once in a while to the ocean shoreline but really never goes far into the woods. This leg of the trail is much more challenging with rocks, roots and mud. The trail is not marked but is very obvious so again getting lost is not a worry. \n\nThe last bit of the backside cuts straight accross the point back to the parking lots. Half of this is through the woods and half of it is through barren plains. Low bushes with spots of pine trees poking up. \n\nI would recommend sturdy and waterproof boots with ankle support, especially if you plan to complete the loop. The backside is where these are needed in particular. \n\nOver all its a great hike with beautiful views. I completed it in roughly 2.5 hours and that was with several rest/snack stops. \n\n", "Trail was great, especially for this time of year. Definitely some mud to run into that may slow ya down but easy to get around. Great time overall. \n\nPs. Be careful with off leash dogs. Was warned of porcupines.", "Beautiful views! very muddy & wet portions of the trail. Expect to throw sneakers in the wash. ", "Great trail. Bit muddy. I started counterclockwise which i preferred as first 1k of trail is meh. ", "Very wet and muddy but not impassible doing the loop, and no flies!", "Awesome hike around the point then up to army shack", "One of my most favourite trails. Easily navigated with sweeping ocean views and sounds of waves crashing the entire way. Enjoy some beach time when done!! Highly recommend.", "Worst trial.", "Gorgeous trail, but as others have said, the last portion of the trail is very challenging in terms of getting lost due to overgrowth, lack of markings and lack of trail maintenance. Best time to hike this one is in the spring before everything blooms and obstructs the view of the trail. First time I did this trail in the summer I had to do a lot of bushwacking. In the spring I didn't get lost at all. Definitely a worthwhile trail with gorgeous views.", "Great hike! Beautiful colours. A few downed trees in the way and a lot of muck in certain sections. ", "Trail is hard to follow, must get out by dark", "Beautiful first half. Back half hard to follow and swampy in places. Lots of wild blueberry.", "This is a beautiful trail.  However the back half of the trail is muddy and not well maintained.  Recommend turning back at the marsh section.   Back half is poorly marked as well.", "A bit more challenging then I anticipated. But a fantastic hike.  Trail tough to follow at times. App kept me on route.  A must do again!", "lovely first half starting from the public beach followed the spray painted blue rocks, got about 6km down and found the rock with a smiley....should have been a sign to turn around! the path pretty much disappears for 2km and I was scambling around on rocks right on the water, pretty dangerous. for sure wear long pants and boots with ankle support.", "Absolutely Loved this trail! We went August 3rd, 2019 as a family, two boys 7 and 10 and my hubby. Took us about 4 hours stopping for lunch, pictures and a few water breaks. There weren\u2019t  really much muddy spots because of the dry weather a few grown in spots, we all wore shorts and we\u2019re fine. Such a piece of paradise!", "Visited on July 31st 2019. Had no trouble staying on the path until about half way around the loop, couldn't find the trail and doubled back. We went clockwise, starting at the beach and past the nude beach! It was foggy but beautiful scenery and ocean mist/spray along the way. Didnt find it too boggy or wet as it's been very hot with little rain lately. My 6 month old puppy had no trouble on our route. Bring your bathing suit for a swim at Crystal Crescent Beach afterwards!", "Great trail. Loved every minute of it. Great views. Good photo opportunity. Some parts could be muddy. A must visit when in the area. ", "Beautiful trail with lots of interesting rock formations and stunning ocean views. Still some mud and bog but drying up a bit with the lovely weather.", "if you are traveling and do not have access to spare hiking shoes/boots i do not recommend doing the western half of the loop... its too wet and muddy... \ni followed the trail clockwise, going along the eastern shoreline...when i got to the southern most part i thought to myself \"maybe i should just double back.\"   this trail is a spectacular out and back trail... would have been a 5 if id chosen to do that but alas i chose to do the loop...the western half was \"meh\"... in comparison... ", "Amazing views along the coast. Trail was very muddy and there was a small stream we had to cross, so be prepared to get your shoes wet. Make sure to keep your dog on a leash; I spotted some porcupines right by the trail.", "I do not recommend completing the loop unless you\u2019re looking to get wet and muddy. Stay on the ocean side as the in land portion of the trail is extremely muddy at this time. Trail is well marked for the most part ", "I would recommend this trail to hikers of all ages especially those looking for dog friendly trails. It starts off with a gravel trail that strings along the coastline. The path turns into a semi wooded semi bluff trail around the point. The views are breathtaking and the sound of the ocean brings a rhythmic calm to the hike. It\u2019s a good idea to bring extra socks and shoes for the drive home. There are quite a few spots along the trail that are very wet and muddy. Also along the hike there are thorny bushes, might be a good idea to wear long pants if it isn\u2019t too hot out. I wore capris and I walked away with a dozen scratches on my calves. It was super helpful to have the blue spray painted markers to help keep you on the right path. All in all a beautiful hike, I will definitely visit again! ", "Loved it, muddy at times bit I picked a rainy day so no complaints. Beautiful views, trail and amazing energy ", "Nice hike around the point and back on the pennant harbor side. Few bouys washed up on the shore !", "First half ( beach side) is well marked with blue paint. Transition to the second part of the trail was hard to find. Lots of wet parts on the trail, definitely wear hiking boots, not meant for sneakers. Great view of the ocean and beautiful beaches.", "Hiked south along the Pennant Harbour side to Pennant Point, returned north across the centre of the peninsula.", "Awesome hike. Views were spectacular!", "Really ended hike at start point at 3.5 hours...just forgot to stop recording. ", "A fun trail with nice views. Keep to the spray painted blue markers to find the trail for most of the way. Be prepared for anything though: mud, rocks, boulders, bogs, overgrown trails...and nudists :/ \nTook me just under 4 hours with a couple stops.", "Fantastic views on this trail for the most part. It took me 4.5 hours to complete the whole trail. For last 1 hour or so there was a lot of bushwacking involved and there was some mud. Despite that I would definitely recommend checking out this trail.", "Just walked to the point and back - absolutely spectacular!", "Kniiy", "Difficult to find some paths. I made a route of my own along paths. I enjoyed it.", "Good trail. I\u2019ll be back again.", "Great trail. If you start on the beach someone has spray painted blue squares to help guide you to the point. After the point those squares are gone and it can be hard to find the trail at times and may require some bushwacking. \nPhenomenal coastal views and if you go past the point not many people do so you'll enjoy some solitude. Definitely on the top hikes list.", "Nice scenery and a great trail.  Only loses a star because the marking of the route is not always clear so someone might get easily lost.  Great fun and definitely recommend!", "Took about 4 hours to complete 10km hike.  My favorite trial\u263a\ufe0f", "Nice trail along a spectacular seashore. Soggy at times but nothing one cannot navigate around. The part that overlaps with the Crystal Crescent beach trail is easier to follow and equally beautiful. To avoid overgrowth and sogginess go to the tip of the peninsula and back. Amazing views ...highly recommended.", "Very nice hike though easy to get turned around the trail is not marked in a lot of places.", "Wish I had read the other reviewers comments prior to leaving on this trip as I struggled to find a route at the tip. \r\n\r\nThis trail would be much easier to travel in a counter clockwise direction... the trail markers are sporadic blue dots painted on rocks, but are very difficult to spot travelling clockwise.\r\n\r\nAll in all was a lovely hike, despite the bog being incredibly wet from the rain. I will be trying this one again in the future!", "Great loop trail with fantastic atlantic coastal scenery. Trail can become a bit absent in a couple parts, one notably by the large salt water pond near the tip, in which you'll pick up the trail again on the other side by either traversing the rocks on the ocean side or thru the tall grass on the other side of the pond, which could be a bit wet depending on the season. Also if you're doing the trail CCW, the trailhead is not marked with anything but a couple rocks just before it so this is where a previous gps track might help."], "key_words": [["Hiking"],

Highly trafficked trail ", "Great trail, that is relatively flat and shaded in some parts. A few lookouts and then the boardwalk at the end that overlooks the famous Cabot Trail. There were washrooms in the parking lot and half way through the trail. Didn\u2019t see any wildlife and passed probably over 100 people just on my way in and the same going back. There were Parks Canada employees in the parking lot writing tickets for no/expired passes - make sure you have a pass or you will have to go to the kiosk to buy one anyways, or be billed $150 at the end of the season.

A grumpy bird (possibly a louse?) wouldn\u2019t let us pass the trail assuming it had babies near by \u2026. We had to jump over it and run hahaha made for a good story/memory of the trail.

On our way back late afternoon we came across a mother moose and her two adolescents feeding by the trail and waited very quietly in a little outlook spur until they wandered by and we continued on.

Surprised that the trail was not closed, to be honest.\n\nIncredible views from the point we were able to get to and at the various lookouts along the way.\n\nPartial weight bearing on forearm crutches, this trail  was accessible enough for those with similar mobility: a wide path, no roots or ruts, smooth dirt for the most part and the gentlest of inclines.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see moose (though there were lots of tracks), a few garter snakes were basking in the sun on the trail.\n", "Great for a first visit. Have been multiple times; the easy terrain and well maintained trails make it great for any activity level on the loop or the out|back. But after a couple visits you are ready to move on to more exciting hikes, with better views, and less foot traffic. ", "I liked this trail. It was easy and the views are beautiful. NS has a love hate relationship with moose. They killed them off, brought them back and still want to control where they go. I didn\u2019t see any wildlife, and the walk is easy enough.

It is a well maintained gravel (stones) road. It\u2019s not really my preference for hiking, but the scenery on both sides is pretty nice. Great views of the rivers and ponds. Once you reach the Castle Rock trail you can continue on a similar road (red route) or take the yellow route which is mainly in the woods. It is the best part of the hike in my opinion. It\u2019s a lot of uphill, but worth it. The view from the top is pretty impressive.\nWe continued the hike by following the red route back out to the Chester connector trail. Again it is a loose stone road which is great for 4 wheelers and bikes but kinda boring for a hike. \nAll in all, it\u2019s a good hike. There is pretty scenery, and a great view from the top. I\u2019ve done it a couple of times, and would do it again, but I probably won\u2019t do the red route again. \nI think a thank you is in order to the folks who maintain this trail, it is obvious that they work hard to keep this multi use trail in such great shape and so accessible. \nOh... don\u2019t forget to bring bug spray. ", "this is a beautiful hike.  the view is breathtaking at the top. We are going back in the fall when the leaves turn.  would recommend this hike.", "Most of the trail in is well maintained. Once you make it to the loop it\u2019s much rougher. You have three options to hike in; easy, moderate or hard. We took the hard route and I\u2019m glad I had my hiking boots for that section. Absolutely stunning views at the top! Will definitely do it again.", "Amazing scenery along the trail and from the top!", "Beautiful Trail...I\u2019d recommend ice cleats now at the end of March. Making the steep hill climb easier on ice. So much beauty for you to see.", "Beautiful streams and a lake along the way, then a stunning finish.", "Very nice view at the end. Worth the hike!", "Fun hike with breathtaking views once you reach the top of the rock.", "Beautiful view.", "Great trail. Though there is a long portion along the old railway (Rum Runner trail) to get to the base of Castle Rock Mtn it follows along a picturesque creek, ponds and Labrador Lake. If you cycle the rail trail part there is a bike stand to lock up your bikes before doing the Castle Rock climb.\n\nNote the parking location is not signed on Hwy 329 and access to it is right where the trail crosses 329 and looks like you will drive down the trail on the east side. But if you use this map it will help you locate it.", "great trail with an amazing view at the end.", "Nice easy hike but I only gave it 3 stars because 6k of 9k are on the rails to trails. Nice view of Mahone Bay when you get to the top of Castle Rock.", "Castle Rock Trails are accessed from the Chester Connection Trail.  There are currently three trails with varying degrees of difficulty and appropriate uses. Wayfinding posts are now in place and a trailhead kiosk is coming soon. There is parking in East River alongside the rail trail. Up to date information and a trail map is available from www.chester.ca.  This is a new property for the Municipality of Chester.  Your feedback is always welcome.  Enjoy everyone.  It's a lovely hike.", "Gorgeous trail! Excellent for beginners, no mud at all, nice and flat. Definitely one of my favourites! ", "The view from Castle Rock makes it all worthwhile. I did not enjoy the long walk along the Road. In the future I would walk in and out along the old rail line.", "Very easy hike - basically just walked back the tracks several kilometres (away from the ocean - closest to exit 7 but on highway 3. After a few kilometres along the flat tracks you see a little road to the right with a castle symbol on a small sign. As you go along, look for the yellow, red, or blue castle signs. Follow whichever one suits your difficulty level. None of them are overly difficult - I might recommend not taking your dog up the hardest/steepest trail and you have to walk up or down some rock face. Parts of the trails very very muddy - mud holes you had to try to get around. You scramble up the final section of castle rock. There's a Canadian flag at the top and the view of the Atlantic Ocean is beautiful. You can see for miles in all directions due to how high you are. This was an enjoyable hike and I would do it again."], "key_words": [["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Muddy"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"],

There are no ATVs allowed, so the trail is in great shape and you don\u2019t get a mouth full of dust every once in a while. \n\nThe views are just incredible - marshes, water, birds, horses, bridges, dykes, flowers, trees, and more. \n\nWe biked to the Bisset Road trailhead and back and took our time - I had my 2yo son on the bike with me, and we stopped numerous times to explore, hydrate, and have a picnic.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to go back. The route we took was a perfect amount of time and exercise for a late afternoon excursion and supper picnic, and we ended at the beach for some wave watching and smelling the salty air - always good for the soul.", "Beautiful trail for biking. Very flat, nice scenery of the salt marshes. Will be going back again.", "Love this trail! Walk it 3-4 times a week all year long. Peaceful and an easy walk. Lots of wildlife to see... ducks and other waterfowl, eagles, porcupines, the occasional deer. Some well placed benches to pause for a picnic or just listen to the birds and brooks. Highly recommended.", "Such a great place to ride a bike! It was my first bike ride in YEARS but so beautiful. The wind resistance was really tough during the open section and I felt like I was in a dream where you are running but getting nowhere LOL.

Very nice.", "Great spot for a solo hike/walk. Started at the trail head and went to laweencetown beach.

It is definitely more of a biking trail but still a lovely scenic trail to walk with your dogs. We will for sure be back again :)", "Great place for a quick ride.", "Did a nice half marathon today. Was pretty overcast, so not too busy. But still caught such lovely views, including rabbits and horses! It's nice and flat, so I had a really steady pace. Great trail! ", "A great trail to bike on a hot summer day thanks to the winds coming off the water. Biked out to Lawrencetown Beach, which was quite chilly, but very refreshing. The trail is a bit rutted for the first couple of kilometers, but not that bad. Lots of benches available along the trail; we stopped at one in the shade for a quick snack.  ", "17 and overcast when i walked it. Only did about 2.5 kms in and back from bisset road. Great scenic views.  Once you get past the trees its windier so there aren\u2019t any bugs. ", "Great spot for a quick run or walk.   Beautiful views.", "Did this trail today in about four hours. Would definitely recommend lots of sunscreen and many layers as the open areas over the water are very cold and the inland areas get very hot! Lots of bikes!! ", "Great trail for road biking beginners.. quiet chilly, lots of places to rest with amazing views of sunset", "Very windy. Open ocean terrain as far as the eye could see.", "Great trail. So many spots to explore in one place.

Beautiful views of the salt marsh. Can be breezy and cool during cooler months. Lots of different birds in the area.", "Nice and easy out and back trail with beautiful scenery. You can really see how quickly the tide moves when standing on the bridges.", "Love the salt marsh", "Trail is beautiful to walk, run or bike. I have biked the whole thing all the way to Lawrence town beach and back and it\u2019s breath taking. Also a very nice place to walk your dogs or run!", "Cloudy day. Bugs were a bit bad but bearable.", "Good day for a bike ride on Salt Marsh Trail. Dry trail and not much people at 5:00. Got a bit buggy at the end around 5:30-6:00. Good trail overall. Recommend it.", "I really enjoyed this one. It was a gentle easy stroll or walk at a fast pace if you want. A lot of people so it can get busy but the views can be beautiful and places to sit if you want to have a rest. Coming back the same way isn\u2019t as much fun but I still saw lots of birds and the sun reflecting differently on the water. It is a well maintained flat surface. ", "Excellent for hiking or biking. In extreme weather or hot and cold you experience the feeling of being all by yourself.", "We love Salt Marsh trail especially in spring/ early summer and fall. It can be a bit too windy if the weather is windy or gets too hot in peak of hot weather. But otherwise it\u2019s a great trail. You can see blue herons, eagles and many other interesting birds and sea creatures. It\u2019s well maintained and has washroom in the beginning if needed. Great for hiking, biking.", "Would be great for biking, though I wish I didn\u2019t have to double back and return on the same route. Great scenery and bird watching. Loved catching the tide changing at Lawrencetown Beach which is where I parked. Very flat and manicured trail, beginner /afternoon stroll level of skill required. Very much a wheelchair accessible trail!!!!", "High recommend the trail.", "Only walked about 4km on this trail, but it was an easy stroll with beautiful views of the saltwater marsh. I think this trail would be most enjoyable taking a bike and covering more distance.", "I did only a small portion but what I did was easy and enjoyable", "Absolutely awesome. Had my six year old ride along side for 16kms and my three year old in a bike trailer all the way to Lawrencetown beach. My wife stayed with the kids while I rode back to Bissett Lake to get the car. Great day!", "Great biking trail! Scenic, well-groomed. Came out at Lawrencetown Beach - fantastic spot to stop and rest and then turn around and head back. Love it!", "Great views. Must do! Cycling only otherwise won\u2019t see anything", "Definitely preferred biking over walking it!", "Not bad, mostly flat, decent view, good exercise. Bring water and snacks! \n\nWe also saw 2 eagles they were huge and they went woosh woosh wee and flew away i slow motion. Prey coo", "Great trail for on leash dog walking.

If your items fails you while there, take it with you rather than being lazy and leaving it behind. If you must use th washroom, dig a cat-hole and burry your waste. Have a garbage bag for tissues. Tie and take it with you when you leave. Many people assume tissue to be biodegradable but it does not dissolve in hours. It will hang around for long enough that it will be in the way of others.

PLEASE pllleassse be a respectful visitor before this land becomes inaccessible to everyone. ", "Believe the hype. This place is absolutely breathtaking and worth every second of pain to get there. We are moderately experienced and average fitness, and this was a real challenge. It took 2.5 hours in, and 3 hours out. The terrain/elevation graph on here is well worth examining so you can get a sense of what lies ahead; there are many stretches that are unrelentingly steep with loose and uneven footing so knowing just how much longer you have to go on any particular stretch was a sanity-saver for me. Be aware that the trail is also one-person wide pretty much all the way, with steep hillside on one side. Tread carefully! On the outward journey, halfway in you descend into a river valley and this is a good place to rest, and refill water if you have filtration.  Things to take: hiking poles (or a good stick) are essential - trust me, you will need them. And take more water than you ever think you\u2019ll need; my three-litre camel pack ran dry with about 40 mins return to go. And food, whether a packed lunch or a bunch of energy snacks, is a good idea. \n\nAs for the Cove itself - absolutely STUNNING. Meadowlands, hillside, beach, forest, rocky headlands, with a river estuary splitting the beach in two. We spent 2 hours here and easily could\u2019ve spent six more. Next time, we will definitely pack (lightly!) for an overnight. It would be magical!\n\nThe horses were the highlight. Friendly and inquisitive, we spent some time saying hi. A little later when we settled in for lunch the whole herd came running over in the hopes of food - not aggressive, at all, but a group of 1000 KG+ curious horses can be pretty intimidating! We had to move aside and watch as they trampled our stuff and ate what they could; at one point, I had to wrestle my day-pack from one of them who had it in its mouth! Fun, but be ready for them. \n\nThe return is a killer, no bones about it. The descents on the outward route become the ascents of your return, and they can be brutal. By far the hardest part is the final return peak; that river valley I mentioned earlier? Yeah, you gotta climb out of that on your way back. It\u2019s the last 90 minutes and after that climb the trail undulates steeply until the final descent to the trailhead. I imagine most people will be pushed hard by this part; us included!\n\nPack well, allow plenty of time if you think you need to take it slowly/take multiple rest breaks, and you will be rewarded with one of the best hikes in Cape Breton", "awsome \n", "Hiked this trail today - loved it!

Horses make it a pretty unique spot!", "Definitely will be staying multiple nights next time. By far the most challenging and rewarding hike I've done yet. Steep climbs and beautiful views. Seals and horses in the cove. A lot busier than expected, we stayed on a Monday night and there were four other groups.

Lots of vertical hiking keeps your heart rate high for sure. Beware of cow parsnip as it can give you severe burns. Wear long pants as there are raspberry and other bushes to hike through. There is a small river crossing at the halfway point. Easy to cross during the dry season, but a springtime crossing would be interesting. At the end when clear of the bush and walk out onto the elevated meadow heading down to the cove, a breath taking view. The beach, the meadow, the river and the horses!

During the day Saturday we went on a day hike, and returned to find that my new MEC tent had been completely trampled by the herd of wild horses. Poles were snapped, my fly was shredded, and the screening was ripped in several spots. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR TENT UNATTENDED. I wish someone had told me before hand. There was no food in the tent, it was stored elsewhere in a bear barrel. The horses are very de-sensitized and will bite out pieces of your tent so be prepared to set it up in one of the wooden enclosures and not leave it for long periods of time.

A great NS trail. ", "My wife, my son and I are Adirondack 46ers and have hiked a lot over the years. This was one of the best and most beautiful we have done. It helps that today's weather was perfect - low 20s (Celsius), clear sky and modest humidity  - but it is more than that.  We were able to get to Pollett's Cove in 2.5 hours and it took the same time to return. We had been warned that this is an over-nighter, and it would be great to camp and explore the environs. That said, it is a wonderful and very realistic day hike for those with a bit of experience and hike with some speed. There are plenty of things to see - mountain meadows, deep gorges cut by streams and spectacular ocean vistas.  The trees, flowers and grasses are wonderful and conspire to create dramatic views to surprise at almost every turn. Then there is the wildlife. We did not see the mythic wild horses - maybe next time. We did see an abundance of pilot whales and bald eagles.  At one cove, far below us, we saw a coyote fighting with 4 bald eagles and a number of ravens over the carcass of a recently beached pilot whale. This hike has a grandeur about it and a remarkable feeling of remoteness combined with an excellent footpath. With all this said, anyone trying this hike should be prepared to work hard, exercise appropriate safety, be respectful of the environment and be properly equipped. There are very steep parts that can get slick, as well as steep drops. Beginners and many intermediate hikers will find much more accessible and appropriate trails in the Cape Breton National Park.

Hogweed can cause painful blistering to the skin if one comes in contact with the sap. So (as always) be mindful while trekking along the trail.

There is a beautiful brook midway to have a nice break at but coming back and climbing that midway hill was a challenge. This hike was like walking into a storybook world. The cove is absolutely\nBreathtaking. But so is the hike itself. A challenging one but most definitely worth it. One word of advice, the horses are VERY curious so be careful. We set up our tent and went down to walk the beach quickly and came back to 9 horses eating all our food and beating down our tent. Had to make- shift back together but even through all of that this hike is 100% worth it! And left us with great stories to tell. Would recommend for sure, just make sure you are ready for a challenge in climbs and some very friendly horses. ", "Other than a few light stream crossings and some exposed drops, this is a fairly moderate trail. The wild horses are gorgeous and extremely well accustomed to people. We saw a baby horse as well as a very pregnant mom as well!\n\nProposed to my girlfriend here - a special place for a special time :) ", "Beautiful hidden gem in the Cape Breton Highlands!", "Best place on earth", "Beautiful, I would definately do it again. The horses at the end of it make it all worthwhile. If you are choosing to share food with them, be prepared to be surrounded  by them all lol.... we went in and out in one day, 3 hours in and about 2.5 back....", "Note, this is the return hike only, with the end point being the trail head. See also my \"Hike In\" for the trek to Polletts Cove..............\n\nOn Thursday and Friday we hiked Pollett\u2019s Cove, which is in NW Cape Breton in the Aspy Fault Wilderness. The only access to the cove is via boat or the narrow trail we travelled on. It is owned by a local lottery winner who generously makes it available for public use. The hike starts near Gampo Abbey, a Buddist monastery in Pleasant Bay. The trail mostly follows the coast line and is 8km in each direstion. It starts with a very nasty climb until you reach a stretch that is briefly flat along a cliff edge. It is followed by 3 knolls and then a steep decline into the cove valley. The trail is narrow throughout, and often traverses near vertical slopes and cliffs, often rough with loose rocks. The weather was hot and muggy. I would not want to travel these sections in wet weather as it would be very treacherous. The latter part of the hike had a couple of stretches through deep wild roses and other 6 ft tall vegetation. As we were staying overnight, we carried heavy packs with our necessary gear. In total the track had 2800 ft of elevation change. Easily the most difficult we have completed so far. The cove was outstanding consisting of a valley with a mountain stream draining to the ocean and populated by at least 11 wild horses who are very tame and curious about campsites. The night we were there there were about 12 fellow hikers staying overnight, all half our age. It was fun watching the horses visiting the campsites in hopes of food rewards. Among the horses was a foal who was still nursing. While in our tent reading, some visited us as well. A beautiful place truly in the wilderness. This was our first overnight tenting hike and we had a sleepless night which made the trek out exhausting. We were awakened by coy-wolves howling on the nearby hillside. On the trail, some of our fellow hikers came across a bear cub.\nWe will visit here again though we will be more economical with our packs which were too heavy.", "Aug 2nd hike on a warm humid day. This recording is the hike to the cove as we stayed overnight. The early portion of the hike was a long and steep climb on a narrow trail. Most of the remainder was up and down good sized knolls also on a narrow trail. Overall a difficult track but very worth while once the cove was reached. We swam in the stream that drains into the ocean and camped in the valley. Currently 10 wild horses live in the valley and we found them very tame."], "key_words": [["Hiking", "Over grown"], ["Backpacking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking", "Muddy", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Backpacking", "Muddy"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Camping"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Fishing"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Backpacking"], ["Backpacking", "Great!"], ["Camping", "Great!"], ["Camping", "Great!"], ["Backpacking", "Private property"], ["Backpacking", "Over grown", "Rocky", "Scramble"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Nature trips", "Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Over grown"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking", "Blowdown", "Muddy"], ["Blowdown", "Over grown"], ["Hiking", "Great!", "Rocky", "Scramble"], ["Hiking", "Blowdown", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Muddy", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Hiking", "Over grown", "Private property"], ["Hiking", "Over grown"], ["Hiking", "Blowdown", "Muddy", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Cross-country skiing", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking", "Over grown", "Private property", "Rocky"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Muddy", "Over grown"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Over grown", "Rocky"], ["Backpacking", "Rocky"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Camping"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking"], ["Hiking"], ["Backpacking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking", "Great!"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Hiking"], ["Camping"], ["Hiking"]], "ratings": ["5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "3 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "1 Star", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "NaN Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "1 Star", "5 Stars", "3 Stars", "0 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "4 Stars", "4 Stars", "4 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars", "5 Stars"]}, "meta": {"description": "Pollett\u2019s Cove is a 8.2 mile out and back trail located near Red River, Nova Scotia, Canada that features a river and is rated as difficult.

", "Full train information can be found in Benoit Lalonde's book \"Waterfalls of Nova Scotia\"\r\n\r\nFirst quarter of the trial is on a dirt road. Unfortunately people have elected to use the road as a place to dump household items in a few locations. The remainder or the trail is through a clear cut, that was likely cut more than a dozen years ago. The trail through the clear cut follows the rough roads used for logging machinery. I notice red flagging tape through the clear cut portion of the train.

Located near a subdivision, this is a popular spot to visit. Since this place is close to the city, they did make sure to ensure ample parking. \r\n\r\nThere are several trails from the parking lot (one goes right, and one goes left). We ended up going left during our trip. The paths are well maintained and follow the lake. I found as though the trail intersections could have been better labelled, as we had a bit of an issue finding the correct one back to the car. \r\n\r\nYou can access the lake in several different spots where you can swim if you'd like. The only ones in the lake when I was there were a couple of doggie friends! \r\n\r\nThere is no admission, and as far as I'm aware, no services - including no washrooms. \r\n\r\nTrails are easy\r\n\r\nHope this was helpful, and I hope you check out the video to get a better sense of this park!", "This Trail is part of the Long Lake Provincial Park, it is an upgraded trail for all users.
