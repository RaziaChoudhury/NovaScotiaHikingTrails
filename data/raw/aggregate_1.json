This section is very steep and quite a workout. I would say the trail up is advanced. Conditions were very muddy and slippery but passable on the dry edges of the trail. Look off at the picnic table is the reward. \n- Next, skipped a portion of the upper Jodrey trail and opted to go to the pavement road and walk the rest of the way up to the campground and through it to the end where the Jodrey trail starts again.

Trail is a short loop. \n- Did the Woodland Trail (although didn\u2019t see it at first from the beginning of the Look Off trail - then found it a few feet away) back to the campground. This is a direct trail through the woods which saves a lot of time getting back. Trail was 100% snow covered, but was very easy. This is the road less travelled and the conditions were better. \n- Walked through the campground to go back - took the paved road the whole way back down to the beach. Stopped into Border Brook Falls as there\u2019s an access point along the road. These waterfalls are extremely high and lots of water flowing as it\u2019s the melting season. From what I could see of this trail is mostly looked bare, muddy in spots though. Stairs at the bottom were clear. \nOverall, a challenging trail when starting from the beach parking lot and returning. For the less experienced or in shape hiker, would recommend starting from the campground once it\u2019s opened to avoid scaling up the side of the cliff to get to the top. \nTook us about 4.5 hours to do but we stopped to picnic several times and we had a dog with us. We just took it slow and enjoyed it. Could probably be done in 3 in perfect trail conditions. ", "It\u2019s a beautiful trail! It\u2019s a long haul, the beginning of the trail is very steep up through a forest over tree roots. Some of the little wooden staircases have seen better days, and when it\u2019s mucky/autumn with leaves on the ground, it\u2019s more difficult to climb up, but picnic benches along the way with great views make it worth it. After the first 20 minutes of climbing up the cliff, the rest is more gradual ups and downs that are a lot more manageable. Along the way you pass by the campgrounds in various spots, which means you have access to rest rooms along the way which is really nice. Further on there are wooden look offs over the Minas basin - you shouldn\u2019t wander around the cliff side around these as the ground isn\u2019t stable in spots.

The hike starts off relatively flat for about 50 minutes. Afterwards, you decent a steep hill for about 50 minutes before arriving at sea level with incredible coastal views. Note the decent consists of loose rock and dirt. We did not have poles but they may have been helpful. Once you\u2019re at sea level, there is loads to explore. We set up camp to the left of the lighthouse, about 15 minutes from the bottom of the hill. It was nice and flat with a fire pit. There\u2019s a waterfall if you continue further to the left where you can refill water and an area you can get down to a beach for a swim if the water is calm enough. It was about 35 degrees when we went so we were dying for a dip! Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t see any horses however we spent hours watching the seals and the birds go fishing. We collected some twigs and driftwood to make a fire, and around 8 pm it started to get quite stormy. A little rain and A LOT of wind.

Recommendation - pack lots of water (and some snacks)!!! It is definitely worth it!", "Hiked in August 2020. I'm giving this hike a 5 for adventurousness and difficulty!! This was one hell of a hike for a couple of beginners (yes, we now know it wasn't the best idea). I have hiked the South Shore and Cape Split (mostly easy to moderate trails) and--woah--did this one hurt! The quads were burning. Both my boyfriend and I are not overly active folks. However, we both work at Michelin slinging heavy rubber all day on our feet for 12 hrs and I was working out at the time as well. Although I stopped often to rest my burning quads, I felt competent the entire time. The way up is VERY steep. This is NOT a biking trail by any means! It is a thrill when you get to the top looking down through the trees at the bay (and when you get to the top/plateau area/old road, KEEP TO THE LEFT!). Especially when you reach the other side of the plateau before your decent, looking over the ocean shore. This decent is also VERY steep and very rocky, many loose rocks falling under your feet. A walking stick for those who enjoy them is an asset for this trail! When you finally reach the shore, you get to see the mountainous fruit of your labour behind you and it's absolutely breathtaking! We began the trail at around 2pm and it was around 530pm when we got to this point so we took some photos, watched the horses, then began our trek back up (did not do the entire shore trail to the old ruins/lighthouse). We got all the way back down and to the car around 8pm just to see the gorgeous sunset! We drove a Chevy Cruze on the road up to the trail and our car didn't mind this at all, for those worried about needing an SUV. Yes there are some holes and it's uneven in places but I don't think an SUV is necessary. A WARNING TO NOVICE HIKERS: This was my boyfriend's second day of hiking for the very first time, which I DO NOT recommend to anyone! This is a VERY VERY difficult trail. I find it hard to believe some seasoned hikers have said it took them an hr to hike up and 40 mins to hike back down? That's insane. My bf puked on the way back up and had to stop MANY times, almost every 10 mins, often to the point of tears. My fear of bears and moose quickly turned into a fear of actually getting him up that hill! But I was his biggest supporter and I knew he could do it. Slow and steady--and he did!! But I had to carry both packs. Take at least 1 gallon of water with you. You'll need it! We lived and learned our lesson here. I'm not trying to scare anyone with this story, just wanted to warn any beginners out there!! Stay safe, guys!!", "awesome trail. It is hard. that uphill is a killer. loose rocks and tree branches. horse were intimidating but friendly. Nice views.", "Great trail to a beautiful cove. It had friendly horses too!!", "we ended up doing the 17km hike at the end of money point road because Road 6014 was washed out on the way up.

It took 5hrs.\n\nFor this hike starting from money point, you get an extra hill for a bonus right off the bat.  it's about as hard as the other hill but not as steep. There the small Creek at the start too, tasted great.\n\nAfter 2k up, and then walking another km, you get to where the trail starts like everyone else mentions. Walking stick helps for those hills. \n\nView at the end is beautiful, and lots of structures. \n\nDidn't see any animals but we did meet some guys that camped the night, and another that was camping at the top of Road 6014 and money point meet.

In truth it's somewhere near the border of those two and where it falls may depend on the individual. Some will have a tough time going up and down, while others will find it to be not as difficult as things they've hiked in the past. It's not quite as tough as Tenerife, which is a comparable style of hike, so if you were able to complete that one you'll be fine. But it is tougher than many other trails in Cape Breton.

You\u2019ll begin your climb as soon as you get to the other side, but you\u2019ll be rewarded right away with great views over the lake. \n\nOur favourite part of the hike was toward the very end. There is a quick moving stream that feeds the lake along the trail. Along this stream is a series of trees roots that encompass the entire ground. It\u2019s magical.\n\nTo see what I mean, check out the video at www.youtube.com/joshthetravelguy ", "The second half can be a little bit technical with many rock climbing if you choose to walk along the lake.

There are also several boggy spots, in particular around little liberty and big red lakes. Liberty lake was beautiful! I saw a bear and an owl, great day!

Seeing the portage system through that section of the park was also pretty cool. Campsite 28 was another gem!\n\nDay 4 - Campsite 28 to Jakes Landing - 16km of service road and road walking. Boring walk, forest was lovely, eel weir was very cool.\n\nAll told the full loop covers 78km, with very little elevation to speak of. The camping was great!

Be sure to turn left around the 0.5 km point to go towards the beach.
